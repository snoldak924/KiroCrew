"""Write the ACP turn lifecycle to an append-only per-session crew log.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/crew-log-emitter.md`` for the contract this
module implements. In short: each entry point is a one-line call at a site in the
dashboard chat path where a lifecycle fact is already known, and every one of
them is **fail-soft** -- a crew log error is reported once and then swallowed, so a
broken crew log can never break a turn.

The module is on by default and inert when ``KIROCREW_CREW_LOG`` is set to a
falsy value (``0``/``false``/``no``/``off``). With the flag off nothing is
created and every call returns immediately.

The grouping identity of a session entry is ``data.turn`` -- the runner's own turn
ordinal -- and, inside a turn, ``data.step``, the MODEL CALL the entry belongs to.
A tool entry also carries ``data.call_index``, its position among that turn's tool
calls, which is what ``step`` meant before a model call had a name of its own: one
model call can issue several tools at once, so the step cannot order them. All are
known at EMIT time, so an entry answers "what happened in this turn" on its own,
with nothing to look up and no earlier line to resolve against.

The envelope's ``thread`` field is left unset here. ``thread`` points at another
LINE's ``seq``, which only a unit whose anchor line is written before the entries
citing it can supply; that is the crew's log shape, not this one's.

Three things are recorded differently from a naive reading of the lifecycle, all
deliberate and all explained in the spec:

* ``compaction/applied`` carries context-usage **percentages**, because the
  compaction boundary never learns a raw token count.
* A tool call and an approval are identified by an id inside ``data``, not by
  ``ref``. A ``Ref`` is a citation of another crew log's lines, and a tool call id
  names a frame on the ACP stream, which is not a crew log unit.
* A turn that ends without its terminal event is still CLOSED, by the turn's own
  ``finally``: ``stop_reason: "failed"``, an ``error`` naming the exception class
  when one was caught, and no ``tokens`` or ``credits``, because none were
  measured. Leaving the start open would say the writer died, which this process
  being alive contradicts -- and nothing here would correct it, since the
  interrupted-turn repair is opt-in and only a resume or a supersede asks for it.
  A recovery re-entry anchors its own thread carrying ``depth``.

**Storage never runs on the caller's thread when that thread is the event
loop.** Every entry point is called from the dashboard's async chat path, and
the storage call underneath takes the unit's lock, reads a bounded tail to
assign ``seq`` and ``fsync``s the appended line -- a waiting ``flock`` and a
kernel ``fsync`` once per tool frame and once per turn, on the one loop that
also drives the liveness heartbeat. So an entry point does only what must be
measured where it is called and builds the storage call as a job for the durable
writer, :class:`kiro_crew.crew_log.writer.CrewLogWriter`, whose single worker (the
pool :func:`kiro_crew.executors.crew_log_executor` builds) drains the work in the
order the call sites produced it.

**Which turn an entry belongs to is carried IN the entry, not looked up.** Every
session entry that belongs to a turn names it in ``data.turn`` -- the runner's own
turn ordinal, which the call site already holds -- plus ``data.step`` for the model
call it happened in, and a tool entry also carries ``data.call_index``. So nothing
has to be cached,
read back from a line written earlier, or kept alive across a queue: an entry is
self-describing the moment it is built, and a lost or evicted piece of in-process
state cannot make it name the WRONG turn.

The envelope's ``thread`` field stays unset on a session entry. ``thread`` points
at another LINE's seq, which is only knowable for a unit whose anchor line is
written before the entries that cite it; that is the crew's log shape, not
this one's.

**Two collaborators own the rest, and this module installs both.** The durable
write policy -- the buffer and its ceilings, retention and backoff, the
``write/dropped`` loss marker, the inline path, the shutdown drain -- is
:mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.writer`. The live-turn memos -- the step and call ordinals,
the settle-once tool registry, the attempt counts, the supersede repair's debt -- are
:class:`kiro_crew.crew_log.turn_tracker.TurnTracker`. Both are imported and built on
first use rather than at import, for the boot-path reason :func:`_crew_log` gives,
and :func:`reset_caches` retires both so the next use builds fresh ones. New work on
how an append reaches the file belongs in the writer; new per-turn bookkeeping belongs
in the tracker; what a lifecycle fact records belongs here.

With no event loop running the write happens inline on the calling thread --
which is what makes a synchronous caller, and the test suite, deterministic.
:func:`flush` waits for the buffers to drain when a caller needs the file on disk
before it looks, and :func:`drain_for_shutdown` is the quiescence barrier a
restart needs: buffered entries are in memory, so an exit that skips it loses the
last thing each session did.

    superseded crew log carries :func:`_terminal_dropped`, and its loss is the trigger

    TWO constraints pull in opposite directions, and neither ordering of "finish" and
    "fire the hook" satisfies both, because finishing does two things at once. The
    terminal's ``after`` is :func:`_closing`'s release, which (a) releases the turn's

      trigger left. (cross-thread race)
    * Fire the hook AFTER finishing: finishing has already cleared the debt, so the
      hook reads an empty slot and re-queues nothing.

    So neither is done blindly. The debt is read BEFORE finishing (preserved through
    the cleanup), the finish releases the live-turn pin, and the repair is re-queued
    from that reading -- now the pin is gone, so the repair closes the tail truthfully
    instead of standing down against our own dying turn. :func:`_queue_tail_repair` is
    the one submission site and is guarded, so re-queuing from the reading is exactly

    ``previous`` means the crew log the SAME slot was writing, and the reference
    says so, but the id reaches this emitter from the slot-to-session mapping --
    a persisted file whose entry can be stale or recycled by the time a successor
    cold-starts. So the invariant is CHECKED rather than assumed, against the
    candidate's own header, which is written once at create and never rewritten.
    Comparing the mapping against itself would prove nothing; the header is the
    crew log's own statement about which slot it belongs to.

    Answering False on any failure is deliberate, because an edge is worth writing
    only when the two crew logs are KNOWN to be one slot's. A candidate whose
    header cannot be read -- retention removed the crew log, or its header line is
    unreadable -- is not known to be this slot's, and sending a reader down an
    unverified edge lands it somewhere this slot never wrote, which is worse than
    ending the walk one link early. A session with no slot has no slot identity to
    match, so it gets no edge either.

    ``unit_header_slot`` is the accessor rather than ``CrewLog.open`` because this
    path must not write, and ``open`` does: its torn-tail truncation is
    unconditional, deliberately so, since trailing bytes that are not a whole line
    are not a record. Harmless in itself, and still wrong here -- a verification
    read would take the crew log's lock and rewrite a candidate's file while asking
    for nothing but one field. The accessor states the opposite contract, no lease
    and nothing written, and its ``None`` means "cannot prove" rather than "no such
    field", which is the refusal this function already wanted. It is also stricter
    than ``open``: it refuses a linked directory, and a header whose own ``id`` does
    not fold back to the directory holding it, both of which would let one store
    answer for another unit. Its own docstring names this caller's position exactly
    -- a unit id reached through a channel the caller does not fully trust.

    Nothing is caught here because the accessor answers ``None`` for every
    unreadable-crew-log case itself, down to the directory walk and the header
    parse. Anything it still raises is a bug in this module, and it belongs in the
    log rather than swallowed into a permanently silent "not the same slot", which

    slot-to-session mapping cannot answer it -- an allocation whose history replay
    is pending holds the prior resumable id there on purpose, so for that window the
    mapping names a generation older than the store the slot is writing.

    FOUR answers, because a caller must tell three kinds of empty apart. A ``sid``
    names the store. ``decided`` false is "the units could not be read, or do not
    say" -- a unit that would not open, more than one uncited unit -- and falling

    The two DECIDED empties differ by ``complete``, and a caller that flattens them

    The repair half of a supersede. The successor's ``session/opened`` only NAMES
    the crew log the slot was writing before; this closes that crew log's own
    dangling ``turn/started`` as ``turn/completed {stop_reason: "interrupted"}``
    and its open ``tool/called`` frames as ``status: "unknown"``, which is what
    makes a fold able to tell an interrupted turn from one still running. Without
    it every gateway restart leaves one permanently open tail per active slot, and
    that turn's cost, duration and outcome are absent from every reading of the
    file for the rest of its life.

    **The deferral is the queue, not a decision.** This job is submitted into
    ``previous_sid``'s OWN bucket, and the writer runs a session's jobs in
    submission order -- so it cannot run until everything already owed for that
    crew log has been attempted. That is the whole ordering requirement, and
    taking it from the buffer rather than from a fresh predicate is what makes it
    resumable by construction: a real ``turn/completed`` still queued or retrying
    at supersede time is written BEFORE this runs, and one abandoned after its
    attempt budget is spent is dropped and admitted in a ``write/dropped`` marker
    before this runs. Either way the tail is closed exactly once and the file
    never carries two outcomes for one turn. Asking at create time instead --
    whether the predecessor still owes anything, standing down while it does --
    leaves nothing that can re-run it: a superseded id is never resumed and
    nothing maps to it once the successor takes over, so precisely the crew log
    that most needs repairing is the one left open for good.

    **The candidate is re-verified adjacent to the write.** The edge already
    refused to NAME a crew log whose own header does not name this slot, so a
    forged mapping entry cannot reach this function through
    :func:`on_session_opened`. What CAN change between that decision and this one
    is the crew log itself: the deferral window lasts as long as the predecessor's
    outstanding writes do, and retention can collect the unit inside it. Asking
    again covers both -- the accessor's ``None`` means "cannot prove", which a
    collected crew log and a foreign one answer alike -- so a unit that is gone is
    a quiet stand-down rather than a ``no_ledger`` refusal the writer would drop
    and count as a lost append, reporting a hole in a file that is gone.
    Asking again is also what keeps the guarantee local: this is the one place an
    outcome is authored into a unit that is not this session's own, and a check
    whose failure costs a foreign outcome belongs next to the write rather than
    inherited from a caller two decisions away. The same
    :func:`_candidate_is_same_slot` the edge uses answers it, against the
    candidate's own immutable header -- one spelling of the rule, so the two
    cannot drift.

    A live turn of ours for that id stands the repair down, exactly as it does on
    the resume path and for the same reason: the turn is still producing entries,
    so closing it would record an outcome it never had and then be followed by the
    rest of it. Standing down is not a hole here, because such a turn ends in its
    own real ``turn/completed``, which closes the tail truthfully.

    Its live record is read as it stands, never released first. ``closer_owed`` is
    set where a terminal is HANDED OVER, so a turn still running is indistinguishable
    from a leaked record by that field alone, and releasing on it would drop the
    record of a turn a forced reset tore down mid-flight -- the one case whose
    closer arrives later, from its own ``finally``. ``on_session_closed`` preserves
    those records for exactly this reason; a release here would undo that and let
    this job write an outcome ahead of a real one. A predecessor whose turn was
    still running at supersede time and whose real closer is later DROPPED is
    covered: the stand-down records the debt with the turn tracker and the terminal's
    own permanent-drop hook (:func:`_terminal_dropped`) re-queues this job once its
    outcome is given up on, so the tail is closed rather than left open. The debt is
    cleared only once the session has no live turn left, so a nested turn landing
    first cannot pay it out from under a sibling still running.

    No ``child_gone`` predicate is passed, so an unmatched ``subagent/spawned`` is
    left OPEN. A superseded crew log's children were dispatched by a session that
    is gone, and this process cannot answer for another process's children: a child
    still running can file its own real terminal, and a synthesised ``unknown``
    ahead of it would leave two outcomes for one ``agent_id`` in a file nothing
    rewrites. Leaving the opener unmatched leaves a reader one fact short; closing
    it can leave a reader wrong.

    Called once per turn, because the per-turn session claim is where the ACP
    id becomes known -- but an entry is written only when there is something new
    to say: the crew log was just created, or this claim RE-ATTACHED to an existing
    conversation (a new gateway process taking over the same session id). A warm
    reuse of a session already carrying a crew log adds nothing, so it is silent.

    ``owner`` and ``agent`` are header fields, written once at create time and
    never rewritten. A resumed session id reuses its existing crew log and
    appends, so an agent or model switch that kept the conversation continues
    one log rather than starting a second one. ``model`` is not a header field
    in the storage schema, so it is carried on this entry instead.

    ``model`` is the id the backend CONFIRMED, and it is empty whenever that id
    is not known. It alone cannot say what the gateway chose: no tier resolved
    anything above the backend's own default, a chosen model was applied, or a
    chosen one never took effect and the backend's choice serves instead (a model
    this account cannot run is withheld before it is sent, and a ``set_model``
    that raises is logged and left alone). Each of the last two can end with an id
    here or without one.

    So ``model_requested`` records what the gateway SELECTED for the ALLOCATION
    that produced this session, and its presence is not conditioned on ``model``.
    The caller resolves that value once, hands it to the provider and retains it
    with the slot, because the turn that observes a session is not always the one
    that allocated it: an eager allocation can outlive a config change, and
    re-resolving at the first turn would record a model that session never used.
    Selection is not transmission either: the withhold happens inside the
    provider, so this field names the choice rather than a message the backend
    received. The pair is the record -- ``model`` states what serves the session,
    ``model_requested`` what was chosen -- and the entry infers nothing from the
    two. A difference between them is not by itself a refusal, because the backend
    serves the spelling it resolved; whether a choice was APPLIED is not something
    this entry knows, and a reader that needs it reads the provider's own outcome
    rather than comparing these strings. Absent ``model_requested`` means no tier
    resolved one, OR that this process did not observe the allocation (a re-attach
    carries provenance from a process that is gone) -- and on an entry written
    before the field existed it means nothing at all.

    ``parent_slot`` names the session that made this one through
    ``session_create`` (the slot's ``_created_by``), and ``parent_sid`` the
    creator's ACP session id as ``session_create`` froze it at mint (the slot's
    ``_created_by_sid``) -- the creator crew log that holds the call. The edge is
    written on the CHILD because that is the side that knows it: the creator is
    stamped on the slot at mint, before any turn, while the creator never learns
    the child's session id, which is assigned at the child's first turn. The sid
    is NOT read live here: a creator slot can be closed and replaced between the
    mint and the child's first turn, and a live read would cite the replacement's
    crew log in an entry that can never be corrected. Both empty means nobody
    created this session (a person's own tab, a fork) and no ``parent`` is
    written at all, so a fold can tell "no creator" from "creator unknown".

    ``memory``, ``app`` and ``channel`` record WHAT KIND of session this log
    belongs to: the slot's memory mode verbatim, the app that owns it if one does,
    and whether its conversation is published to a messaging channel by a link or
    a mirror. They are written as one ``class`` object and only when ``memory`` is
    given, which makes that member the witness that the class was recorded -- so a
    reader can tell a session with nothing to declare from a log written before
    this existed, and must refuse rather than assume on the second.

    They belong on the record rather than in a live lookup because the question
    they answer -- may another session read this log -- is asked about sessions
    that have CLOSED, and a closed session has no slot left to ask. They are also
    facts and not a verdict: recording "readable" would freeze this build's reading
    of a rule into an entry that can never be corrected. The facts are true when
    the log is opened; a class a session ACQUIRES later (a channel link added
    mid-conversation) is not in them, so a reader that can also see the live
    session applies both and refuses on either.

    ``previous_sid`` names the crew log this SLOT was writing before, and it
    answers the continuity ``resumed`` cannot. ``resumed`` is true only when this
    claim re-attached to the same crew log; when the ACP session was instead torn
    down and a successor cold-started, the successor has a different id and
    therefore a different unit, and nothing in the record joined the two. So a
    ``create`` that is handed a DIFFERENT prior id writes ``previous {sid}``, and
    the comparison is made here rather than trusted from the caller: on the resume
    path the prior id and this one are the same store, and an edge pointing at
    itself would make a chain walker loop. Empty, or equal to this session, means
    no edge is written -- the slot's first crew log, and a predecessor the gateway
    could not name, are both "nothing to follow" rather than a store with an empty
    name.

    The edge itself is a citation and nothing more: this entry records which store
    came before, and no writer here touches that store. Closing the superseded
    store's own dangling turn and tool calls is a SEPARATE job, queued under that
    store's id so it runs behind whatever that store still owes -- see
    :func:`_repair_superseded`. Keeping the two apart is what lets the entry land
    at once while the repair waits for an ordering it cannot have yet.

    ``tokens`` is what was BILLED: it is summed over every model call the turn made,
    so it answers what the turn cost. Occupancy answers how full the window was, and
    a reader wanting "how close to full did this session get" needs the second --
    dividing a billed total by a window size is not that number, and on a

    dimensions, zeros included, because its schema requires each member and a zero
    INSIDE a reported block is a real zero; ``background/completed`` drops the zero

    A child is reported present while this process owes ANY entry for
    *session_id*, on top of what the registry says. A terminal outcome reaches
    the file through the writer and :func:`_submit` returns before it lands, so a
    child leaves the running set while its own closer is still queued: the file
    then shows an opener with no match while the registry omits the child. Closing on that reading puts a synthesised ``unknown`` ahead of the
    real outcome and leaves both standing in a file nothing rewrites. The debt
    set is the exact record of what is still owed -- queued, claimed by the

    Neither read is enough on its own, because the normal completion path flips
    ``done`` long BEFORE the closer is recorded: the manager's running set is
    everything not done, so the child leaves it at the flip, and the terminal
    entry is handed over later from the report task. Between those two the child
    is absent from the running set and owes nothing, and a repair reading exactly
    there synthesises an ``unknown`` that then stands beside the real outcome. So
    the child's OWN origin pin is consulted too: it is opened when the spawn is
    recorded and released only once the closer has been handed to the writer, an
    interval that contains that whole gap, and it is per-child rather than

    A TODO update is a WHOLE list, not a delta: the agent re-sends every task on

    consecutive entries itself. ``items`` is the stream's own ``tasks`` array of
    ``{id, text, completed}``. ``None`` means the event said nothing about the
    plan and no entry is written; an empty LIST means the agent cleared its plan,
    which is a change and is recorded as one.

    ``state`` is two-valued -- ``done`` / ``open`` -- because that is all the
    stream carries. The backend's todo model is a plain ``completed`` boolean with
    no in-progress state, as the slot's own snapshot code documents, so a
    three-state vocabulary would be invented here and is not written.

    The list is bounded twice, by COUNT and by BYTES, and both bounds keep the real
    count in ``total`` so a clipped record still says how much it is not showing.
    Count alone is not enough: ``_clip`` bounds each ``text`` in characters while the

    steers and finishes long after that turn has ended, and every later entry
    about this child reuses the captured ordinal instead of asking what turn the
    parent is on now.

    No ``ref`` into the child's log. The schema describes one, and a child that
    had a crew log would deserve it, but no subagent code path opens one: the only
    site that creates a session's crew log is the dashboard turn path, and a subagent
    run does not go through it. A ``ref`` written now would cite a file that does
    not exist, which a reader cannot distinguish from one that was deleted. It
    becomes writable, unchanged, the day subagent sessions get crew logs of their
    own.

    ``turn`` is ABSENT when no turn asked, the same way :func:`on_model_selected`

    command, a cron and a hook all dispatch children of a session with nothing

    turn that never existed and match no ``turn/started``. The child is still
    recorded: it is a real child of that session, and losing it to keep a field
    populated would be the worse trade.

    ``task`` is what the child was asked to do, redacted and clipped on the same
    terms as ``plan/updated``'s item text -- the other place this module records
    text a person wrote. It is the one thing a reader needs to tell two children
    apart that is not derivable from anything else in the entry, and a surface
    rebuilding a child's card after the dispatching process is gone has nowhere
    else to read it from.

    It is written only when non-empty, so a dispatch that carried no task text

    *producer* is refused outside
    :data:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.entry_types.OBJECT_PRODUCERS`, and refused HERE
    rather than coerced. The value is the point of the entry: a reader trusts a
    measured record because it can see which mechanism measured it, and a producer
    coerced to some default would attribute the record to a mechanism that did not
    make it. The ``ValueError`` is a programming error surfaced at the site that
    made it; the registry's closed enum behind this is the guard a caller cannot
    skip by writing around this function.

    The caller decides WHEN: one call per change of the probe's fingerprint, never
    one per poll, so the log holds distinct states rather than a heartbeat.

    *facts* is recorded verbatim. When the whole line would cross the store's
    ceiling -- a review host reporting hundreds of long check identities can do
    it -- the largest members are removed until it fits and are named in
    ``facts_omitted``, so the record is short by a NAMED part rather than lost
    whole or silently trimmed. Recording nothing was rejected: the change
    happened, and a reader that finds no entry cannot tell "unchanged" from

    ``None`` for every report after a restart while the anchor sat on disk.

    actual bound would take, and it answers a different question (does this seq

    ``src`` is ``gateway`` rather than a crew guest form: the reporting party here
    is a session, and the gateway is what writes a session's report into the crew's
    file.

    *cite_unit* is the reporting session's crew-log unit, and it is what makes the
    required ``ref`` the writer's obligation rather than the caller's: the span is
    built here, from that unit's own newest seq, so a report cannot be written
    without evidence. The span is clamped to the newest ``MAX_REF_SPAN`` lines,
    which is what the cap is for -- a long run is cited by its relevant span
    rather than in full. A unit with no readable log yields no citation and the
    report is not written, because a report with no ``ref`` is an unfalsifiable
    claim in a file nothing rewrites.

    A report whose dispatch anchor does not resolve is written UNTHREADED rather
    than dropped. The anchor can be missing for two reasons, and one of them does
    not heal: a read that failed transiently leaves the dispatch on disk, so the
    item's next report threads normally, but a dispatch whose own best-effort
    append failed leaves no dispatch entry at all -- and then refusing the reply
    refuses every later report for that item too, so the crew log reads for good
    as though the item was never dispatched. Silence about the work is the worse
    record: it is unbounded in time and invisible, while an unthreaded report
    states that the work happened and is merely missing its link.

    What that costs is worth naming, because it is not free. The spec reads a
    report with no ``thread`` as one volunteered with no dispatch behind it, so an
    unthreaded report here is indistinguishable from a volunteered one -- one
    field is ambiguous, rather than one item's whole history being absent. The
    anomaly is logged when it happens, which is where a reader looks to tell the
    two apart.

    The refusal that remains is the evidence one above: no citable unit means no
    write at all, because a report that cannot be checked is a claim, not a record.

    destroy (``destroyed`` or ``destroyed_sid_retained``), each passing the same
    ``end_reason`` it records elsewhere; another teardown path passing its own
    reason needs no change here.

    This entry records a TEARDOWN, not the end of the file. A forced reset -- the
    model-switch route called with ``skip_running`` false -- tears a session down
    while a turn is still running, and that turn's closers are written later, by its
    own ``finally``, in another task; a steer already inside its RPC lands later
    still. So entries belonging to turns that were already in flight MAY follow this
    one, and a reader treats it as "the gateway stopped serving this session for
    reason R" rather than "nothing further appears".

    Holding the entry until the session went quiet was tried and abandoned: nothing
    in the gateway defines quiescence. A turn is pinned only once ``turn/started``
    is written, so an authorization await ahead of it is unpinned; eviction under
    the tracker's live-turn ceiling strands a held reason; and a resume that re-claims the id
    would have to decide whether the predecessor's teardown still happened. Each of
    those is a way to LOSE the terminal, which is worse than a terminal a late entry
    follows -- an absent one cannot be told apart from a crash.

    What this must not do is erase state a live turn still needs. The cleanup below
    drops only what a successor must not inherit; the live-turn records and the open
    tool calls of turns still running are left to their own release, so a turn whose
