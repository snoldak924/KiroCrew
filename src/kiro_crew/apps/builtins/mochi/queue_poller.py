"""Queue poller for Mochi — executes the plan, spawns the agents, self-heals.

Ported from ``src/main/queuePoller.ts`` (693 lines, zero tests). Spec: the
characterization suite written against the TypeScript at port time
(``queuePoller.characterization.test.ts``, 23 tests — migration-only tooling,
not shipped). The poller reads ``mochi-queue.json`` every second, executes due
deterministic tasks (move/notify/mood) through callbacks, serialises agent
spawns (watch checks first, then freestyle), and triggers plan/replan cycles
with failure backoff.

Characterized quirks, preserved:

1. The stale-task comment claimed 2 minutes; the CODE says 30 —
   :data:`STALE_THRESHOLD_MS` is 30 min and planned (non-urgent) move/mood
   tasks older than that are marked done UNEXECUTED.
2. Plan-lock expiry is detected lazily inside a poll and consumes the whole
   cycle (early return: no tasks, no watch checks, no cleanup that round).
3. A successful watch spawn back-dates the lock to a 30s cooldown — which
   also blocks missed-notification recovery within the same poll.
4. A FAILED watch spawn keeps the full 5-minute lock (no 30s shortcut), so a
   dead gateway backs off naturally.
5. Plan-lock release compares ``planned_at >= spawn_at - 1000`` (agents write
   second-precision timestamps).
6. Storm breaker: at most 5 watch spawns per 10-minute window; the cap
   throttles by taking the full watch lock.

PORTING NOTES
-------------

**Clock is a callable, not a parameter.** Every other ported module takes
``now_ms`` per call, but a poll SUSPENDS across virtual time (a spawn wait is
up to five minutes), so a snapshot taken at entry would be stale after the
await. The constructor takes ``clock: Callable[[], int]`` (defaults to wall
time) and reads it exactly where the original read ``Date.now()``.

**Timers are owner-driven.** The 1s poll interval is gone — the owner calls
``await poll()`` on the :data:`POLL_INTERVAL_MS` cadence (``poll`` itself
keeps the original's serialisation: a call landing mid-poll queues exactly one
follow-up). The spawn-timeout ``setTimeout`` became a deadline fired by
``tick(now_ms)``; ``notify_agent_done`` resolves the wait early, exactly like
the WS ``subagent_done`` path. The first-launch grace timer is a deadline
checked lazily.

**Spawn waits are futures.** ``_resolveCurrentSpawn`` maps to a pending
``asyncio.Future`` resolved by ``notify_agent_done`` (id-matched) or by
``tick`` when the deadline passes; the timed-out flag routes the
failure-bookkeeping path, byte-for-byte prompts included.
