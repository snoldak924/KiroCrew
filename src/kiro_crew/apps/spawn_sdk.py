"""Spawn SDK — app-scoped background agent spawning.

An app doing unattended work (a poller, a watcher, a planner) needs to start an
agent turn with no user present. The host already owns that machinery
(``SubagentManager``: concurrency accounting, a reaper for wedged agents, SEL
audit), so this is a permissioned adapter onto it, not a second spawner.

It arrives the way ``cron`` / ``events`` / ``storage`` do — declared as
``permissions.spawn``, injected by the gateway, ``None`` otherwise — so "which
apps may start an agent" reads off the manifest rather than off an import graph.
The core never imports an app to hand it this.

``run`` RAISES on refusal rather than returning a falsy id: the host can decline
(approval policy, caps), and a caller that reads a decline as success waits on a
spawn that never happened instead of counting a failure and backing off.
