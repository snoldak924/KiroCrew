"""Per-crew-member space: ``$KIROCREW_HOME/members/<slug>/``.

A crew member is the same agent running with different context, so its space
holds what belongs to that member alone rather than to the user as a whole. The
first occupant is ``activity.jsonl`` — pointers to the sessions the member took
part in, which is the signal trigger generation reads.

The directory name is a **slug**: stable, immutable, and path-safe. A member's
display name is editable independently, so a rename never has to move files.
This mirrors the artifact store's ``artifacts/<slug>/`` layout, and reuses its
:func:`~kiro_crew.artifacts.slugify` so both surfaces normalize names the same
way.

Activity entries are pointers by design: they carry the session key, not a copy
of what happened. Details are read back from the session itself, so the log
cannot drift from the transcript — and it survives session pruning, which is why
frequency counts taken from it stay stable.

    which the KAS projection's credential stripping never touches (that filter
    applies to the agent-declared ``mcpServers`` block, not to what the host
    itself injects per session).

    ``session_token`` is this ACP session's own name, and it rides BESIDE the key
    rather than replacing it (see
    :func:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.identity.control_plane_identity_env` for

    into this element names the session that was claiming when it was built while
    the token's mapping is republished on every rekey — so a member thread on a
    recycled process resolves to itself rather than to its predecessor. Empty
    leaves the entry byte-identical to the pre-token shape.

    The env also carries ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` — the port this gateway is
    actually serving. Unlike a chat session's MCP child, which inherits the
    gateway's whole environment, this entry is built from scratch, so without
    the port the child's resolution chain falls through to the run marker; that
    check needs :func:`platform_compat.find_listening_pids` (``lsof``), which
    sees no listener from inside the sandbox's user namespace, and the child

    connection refused on every dispatch call. ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` rather
    than ``KIROCREW_PORT`` because the latter means "the port an operator
    asked for" and is persisted, while this is the transient fact of what got
    bound.

    It also carries the same home override every managed Crew server carries
    (``_managed_mcp_env``): the server resolves *which gateway* to call from
    its data home, so on an install where ``KIROCREW_HOME`` is set (a pod, a

    the default home's gateway, which has no such slot and refuses every verb
    as ``caller_unidentified``. On a default install the helper returns nothing
    and the entry is unchanged.

    so the member SEES that its briefing overflowed (and can prune it) rather

    The file is AGENT-WRITTEN, so two properties are enforced at the open,

    * **No symlink following anywhere on the path, no non-regular files, no
      blocking open.** The gateway reads this file with its own privileges
      while building context, so a briefing replaced by a symlink would pull
      any gateway-readable file — including the keystone-gated ``trust/``
      payloads the agent's tools cannot reach — into the prompt, and a
      briefing replaced by a FIFO would make a plain ``open`` block forever,
      hanging the member's turn and exhausting the embed workers. The leaf is
      opened through :func:`~kiro_crew.pinned_fs.open_in_pinned_parent`, which
      walks the ancestor chain one descriptor-relative ``openat`` at a time,
      each carrying ``O_NOFOLLOW`` — an ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on the final component
      alone is not enough, because the member's own directory
      (``members/<slug>/``) is agent-writable too, and swapping IT for a link
      redirects the whole traversal while the leaf open still finds an
      ordinary file. That is why the walk starts from the resolved members
      ROOT with ``<slug>`` appended lexically (:func:`_briefing_pinned_target`)
      rather than from :func:`member_dir`, whose own ``resolve()`` would follow
      such a link before the walk could refuse it.
      ``O_NONBLOCK`` makes a FIFO open return immediately instead of waiting
      for a writer (both at open time — no check-then-open race); ``fstat``
      then rejects anything that is not a regular file. Where the pinned walk
      or ``O_NOFOLLOW`` is unavailable (Windows —
      :func:`member_briefing_supported`) the read FAILS CLOSED to "no
      briefing": a check-then-open probe is exactly the TOCTOU an
      agent-writable path invites (swap a symlink in after the check), and
      the repo's posture on hosts lacking an OS-level control is to refuse,
      not to run the racy approximation.
    * **Bounded read.** At most ``(cap + 2) * 4`` bytes are read (4 = max
      UTF-8 bytes per char), so an arbitrarily large briefing costs a bounded
      allocation, never gateway memory.

    ``memory_mode`` is REQUIRED and positional, not an opt-in keyword: it gates

    """Return a member's activity entries oldest first, and whether they are ALL of them.

    Backed by the per-member append-only event log: reads ``ACTIVITY_RECORD``
    events (newest first from the service), unwraps each to the record dict it
    carries, and reverses to oldest-first — the order the former file-backed
    reader returned. ``limit`` > 0 returns the most recent N. A bad slug or any
    read failure yields ``([], True)``.

    The second element is retained for callers that fail closed on a partial
    read of the agent-writable file. The event log commits one line
    per append under fsync and the reader repairs a torn trailing line at load,
    so a partial-read completeness gap does not arise here — the flag is
    always ``True`` on a successful read. It stays in the signature so the
    ``record_activity`` dedupe probe and its tests keep their shape.
