"""Starting an ACP host process: the one launch tail, and what hosts share to get there.

Both drivers start their child here. ``AcpRuntime`` (one process, many sessions) and
``AcpClient`` (one process per session) each resolve a :class:`SpawnPlan` from their
host's adapter -- a :class:`~kiro_crew.acp.harness.base.HarnessAdapter` on the
runtime, a :class:`~kiro_crew.acp.harness.base.ProcessAdapter` or kiro-cli's own arm
on the client -- and hand it to :func:`launch`, which owns everything from there to
a created, still-suspended process:

1. the pod bundle swap and the sandbox-delegation verdict;
2. the per-process scratch window, joined to the session tree's when one exists;
3. the OS sandbox wrap with the host's credential mask, and the cgroup scope;
4. the child's environment, assembled in one fixed order around each driver's own
   steps (session identity on the client, the spawn instance on the runtime);
5. the macOS workspace binding and the suspended spawn itself.

What a driver does AFTER the process exists -- resuming it, recording its identity,
tracking its pids, draining its stderr -- stays with that driver, because the two
reap a failed start differently on purpose.

The OS-facing collaborators arrive as :class:`LaunchTools`, which each driver builds
from its OWN module's bindings at the moment it launches. That is what keeps a test
that rebinds ``kiro_crew.acp.client.wrap_argv`` (or the runtime's) reaching the
launch it drives, and it is the seam a test of this module fills with fakes.

The rest of this module is what several per-process hosts share before the tail:
the Node-adapter resolution ladder (claude-agent-acp, codex-acp, pi-acp), the
self-served binary ladder (opencode, goose, DeepSeek Harness), the per-gateway
resolution caches' generation fence, the enforced-host credential-mask preflight,
and the plumbing of a host's read-back child. A host's own knowledge lives in its
adapter module under :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.harness`; nothing here names one host.

#: scan bounds the matching work; nothing outside the window is read.
_READBACK_STDERR_SCAN_CHARS = 3200


#: How many recognised fault shapes one refusal reports, most specific first.

#: padded rather than explained.
_READBACK_FAULT_MAX_SHAPES = 2


#: The CLOSED vocabulary of exec-failure shapes a refused read-back can report.
#:
#: Each entry pairs a pattern matched against the child's stderr with the phrase
#: THIS MODULE publishes when it matches, so published text is always a literal
#: written here and never a byte the child wrote. That is the point rather than a
#: side effect. The child is a foreign harness binary and its stderr can hold
#: whatever the operator's environment put in front of it, a credential included;
#: any scheme that ECHOES those bytes has to prove no credential survives, which
#: means proving a negative about arbitrary bytes against redactor patterns that
#: need contiguity and label anchors. One inserted byte -- a line wrap, an SGR
#: colour code -- breaks the anchor while leaving every character of the secret
#: sitting in the text. With an SGR colour code inside a ``glpat-`` token body, 530
#: of 700 splices leave the whole token readable that way: rejoining the run
#: destroys the ``-`` the pattern anchors on, and not rejoining leaves the ``[31m``
#: residue inside it. Reporting a MATCH removes the question instead of answering
#: it -- there is no path from a child byte to published text, so there is nothing
#: left to prove about the bytes.
#:
#: Covers what BOTH read-backs hit, which is why it reaches past exec failures: the
#: pi read-back's launcher refuses an exec, while the opencode read-back parses a
#: config document and can reject the flags it was handed. A shape neither of them
#: produces is not worth carrying.
#:
#: Ordered most specific first, because the shapes overlap: a shebang fault reads
#: ``bad interpreter: No such file or directory``, where the interpreter is the
#: cause and the missing file only its symptom.
#:
#: What this deliberately drops is the DETAIL inside a recognised message -- which
#: line of the config failed to parse, which path the OS refused. A capture would
#: put child bytes back in the output and reopen the whole question for the sake of
#: a number the harness repeats the moment the operator runs it themselves.
#:
#: Case-insensitive, and matched as substrings rather than whole lines, because the
#: launcher's wording differs by platform -- ``/bin/sh``, ``dyld``, ``cmd.exe`` and
#: Node each frame these differently -- while the fault underneath does not.

    A gate read-back that fails reports its child's exit code, and that code alone
    names a verdict without a cause: on the pi read-back the launcher is ``/bin/sh``
    exec'ing the resolved harness binary, so ``exit 126`` is the shell refusing the
    exec, and an exec the OS denied (``Permission denied``), a shebang it cannot
    resolve (``bad interpreter``) and a binary built for another architecture
    (``Bad CPU type in executable``) are three different faults with three different
    fixes. Only the child knows which one happened, so the refusal that reaches the
    operator carries it.

    What the refusal does NOT carry is the child's own bytes. The stderr is matched
    against :data:`_READBACK_FAULT_SHAPES` and the phrase written there for the
    matching shape is what gets published, so the output is drawn from a closed
    vocabulary defined in this module. Nothing has to be proved about the child's
    bytes because none of them are published -- see that constant for the measured
    reason echoing the bytes cannot offer the same guarantee.

    An unrecognised stderr answers ``""``, and the caller then reports the bare exit
    code with no diagnosis. The caller still separates that from a SILENT child, so
    "said something we do not recognise" and "said nothing at all" stay different
