"""The ``/agent <name>`` command, as Crew reads it on every surface.

Crew performs the switch itself instead of forwarding the words to kiro-cli:
with the native skill projection on (the default), kiro-cli is never allowed
to change agents mid-session, and with it off the process would move to the
new agent without Crew's skill scope following. A dashboard chat switches
through ``switch_slot_agent`` (the agent picker's transaction); a Slack thread
not linked to a dashboard chat switches its thread agent.

Mirrored by the dashboard composer's ``agentSwitchTarget``
(``website/src/pages/chat/ChatInput.tsx``), which routes the main composer's
command to the same switch before the message is ever sent.
