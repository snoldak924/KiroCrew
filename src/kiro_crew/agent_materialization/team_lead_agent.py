"""The team-lead crewmate spec: the one generated agent that both leads and works.

Its own module because it shares neither sibling's shape. Every conductor spec in
:mod:`conductor_agents` overwrites the template's tool list with a literal that
withholds ``fs_write`` and ``code``, which is what makes "never does a work item's
work itself" true against the tool list rather than only against the charter. The
dispatched worker in :mod:`worker_agent` keeps the writers and mirrors the default
spec on disk, but an ``opt_in`` set is assigned per agent, so that installer
deliberately strips ``kirocrew-dashboard`` from the mirror and a worker cannot
dispatch at all.

This spec is the union those two leave empty: the template's whole toolset, so a
small focused item it keeps for itself is one it can finish, plus session control
and the work ledger, so everything else is a fleet it dispatches, patrols and
decides for.

EVERY path that writes this spec's filename, and the one invariant each is held
to: never write there when the existing content was not written by this
installer, whether or not that content parses.

* :func:`_install_team_lead_agent` is the only writer in this package, and the
  only one that replaces the file WHOLE with nothing carried forward. Three
  callers reach it and all three are the same function -- the boot rebuild, the
  hourly retry of held specs, and ``kirocrew setup --agent-only --clean`` -- so
  the attribution in one place covers all of them.
* Two shared sweeps edit an owned spec IN PLACE rather than replacing it: the
  retired-key repair that walks ``OWNED_KIRO_AGENT_FILES`` in ``agent.py``, and
  the Playwright convergence in ``browser/setup.py``. Both are keyed on the
  filename rather than on provenance, which is a property every owned spec has
  shared since before this one existed; neither discards a file, and changing
  that shape for one filename is not this installer's to do.

The spec is half of the capability, and the half it is not is worth stating here
rather than leaving to the charter. Driving the owner's dynamic dashboard needs
``dashboard_fields`` / ``dashboard_write``, those verbs resolve the calling crew
from the SESSION and not from an argument, and the server behind them is
``opt_in`` with no spec allowed to emit it at all
(``members.member_panel_session_server``). So they answer in a crewmate's own
thread and nowhere else: a spec cannot confer that on itself, and this installer
does not pretend to. What the spec carries is everything that works without it.

    ADDITIVE, where :func:`conductor_agents._conductor_mcp_servers` is subtractive,

    and drops the rest because it does no work, while this agent runs a build and
    drives git, so a server the template assembles is a server its own half of the
    charter may need.

    ADDITIVE, so what bounds it is stated here rather than assumed. Not mirroring the
    default spec on disk removes one inheritance channel and not the other: this builds
    from ``build_agent_config``, which deep-merges the operator's own ``agent.json`` --
    ``mcpServers`` included -- so an entry they wrote arrives through the template
    itself. Two passes in :func:`_install_team_lead_agent` are what bound it, and
    neither is optional for an additive map: the unassigned ``opt_in`` sets are dropped
    (:func:`_team_lead_unassignable_servers`), and every surviving entry's
    ``autoApprove`` goes through the governance ceiling, which the ``allowedTools``
    filter cannot see. A conductor needs neither, because
    ``conductor_agents._conductor_mcp_servers`` is SUBTRACTIVE and keeps nothing it did
    not put there; this map keeps what it is given, so it filters what it keeps.

    ``kirocrew-dashboard`` and ``kirocrew-work`` are hand-built because both are
    ``opt_in``: neither spec-writing loop emits one, and this installer naming them
    IS the explicit per-agent assignment such a set requires. The dashboard entry
    carries the two fields a copy forgets -- without ``"type": "registry"`` a
    registry-mode client silently DROPS it, so the granted session-control tools
    never launch and the dispatch half of this charter is dead with no local error;
    without the ``KIROCREW_HOME`` pin the shim reads the default data home while the
    gateway runs under an override, so dispatch would act on a different session
    store than the one it reports on. Both helpers return empty on a default

    whatever put it there. The spec id makes a collision unlikely rather than
    impossible, so the guard is what covers the operator who happens to hold a
    hand-authored agent at this name.

    Takes a parsed object, or ``None`` for an ABSENT path. ``None`` -- "ours to
    write" -- is the only state that writes without a name to check, and a file that
    is present and does not parse never reaches here: the caller declines it on
    :data:`_UNATTRIBUTABLE`, because unreadable bytes at this name are still
    somebody's.

    The marks are the declared ``name`` and an ``mcpServers`` entry for each of
    :data:`_DEFINING_SERVERS` -- the shape THIS release writes, and only that one.
    A looser test that also accepted the reference from ``tools`` or a per-tool
    grant was considered and dropped: there is no earlier release of this spec to
    heal, so the leniency would have bought nothing and widened what counts as
    this installer's own file.

    The bound is worth stating exactly, because the marks do not carry it alone.
    Neither mark is a secret, so a file holding both is indistinguishable BY CONTENT
    from this installer's own output. Two different files reach that description and
    they are not the same case:

    * a DELIBERATE forge, which volunteers the forger's own file and costs them only
      what they chose to lose;
    * a crew's PRIVATE COPY, which arrives at both marks with nobody choosing
      anything. A copy is named after the crew that owns it and its declared ``name``
      is set equal to that stem, so a crew named for this agent lands a file declaring
      this agent's name; copy a conductor and that file mounts both
      :data:`_DEFINING_SERVERS` too, because every conductor spec mounts them.

    What separates those two is not a mark but whether anything RECORDS the file as
    somebody else's, which no spec field can carry and no copy can fake. So this
    function is the narrower SECOND question: :func:`_attribution_reason` asks
    :func:`_recorded_fork_reason` first and reaches the marks only for a file no
    record claims.

    What the marks alone still rule out is the reverse -- an ordinary crew, with its

      read in the gap failed. It is raised as the reader's transient class, which

      change that. :data:`_UNATTRIBUTABLE`, so the caller DECLINES: a file with one
      missing brace is the ordinary result of a hand edit, and its bytes are the
      operator's whether or not they parse.

    Declining a file that cannot be made into a spec does not strand this agent,
    which is what makes the trade here different from ``worker_agent``'s. That spec
    is DERIVED from the default and re-checked before every worker session, so
    refusing it would break dispatch with no way out. This one is optional and
    selected by name, exactly like the dashboard-author spec, and it follows that
    spec's documented contract: the file is left untouched, no backup is written,
    and the agent stays unselectable under this name until the operator removes or
    renames it.

    An ABSENT file is the one ``None``, and the only state in which the caller

    ``fs_write`` needs no grant to be mounted and gets none: it is in the template's
    ``tools`` and absent from its ``allowedTools``, which is the default agent's own

    with no argument matching, so trusting the bundled acceptance evaluator cannot be

    ``clean`` is accepted for one reason: every installer in this package takes it,
    and the rebuild passes it to each. It changes nothing here, because nothing on
    the previous file is carried forward -- the spec is a pure function of the
    template, the charter and the tuples above, so there is no user entry to drop.

    that never will.

    ``HELD`` is a read that failed in the reader's transient class. Retrying is
    exactly right: the same read a moment later is what clears an I/O error.

    ``DECLINED`` is a spec this installer did not write
    (:func:`_foreign_team_lead_spec_reason`). Retrying is exactly wrong. The file
    will still be somebody else's on the next pass and on every pass after it, so
