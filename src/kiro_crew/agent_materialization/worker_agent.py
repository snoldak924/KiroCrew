    A whole-server grant on an excluded server is therefore replaced by the SHIPPED

    prompting rather than auto-approved.

    The pass is applied after every source has been folded in, so a ref that arrives
    from the previous worker file is excluded on the same terms as one mirrored from
    the default. That is deliberate: this is a policy about what a worker may skip
    the gate for, not a preference the file it was written into can overrule.

    server -- the mount that IS this agent, and the reason it exists at all. Both have
    been written by every release that produced a mirror, which is what keeps an
    upgrade from turning into a refusal: ``test_worker_agent.py`` pins that a mirror
    left by an older build is HEALED rather than needing a hand-edit, and a mark chosen
    from the current spec's shape (the exact prompt, the mounted server map) would
    refuse those files instead of repairing them. So the reference is accepted wherever
    a release put it -- the server map, ``tools``, or a per-tool grant.

    Neither mark is a secret and a spec could forge them; forging them volunteers the
    forger's own file to be replaced, which costs nothing. What cannot happen is the
    reverse: an ordinary shared crew -- its own prompt, its own servers, its own name

    """Generate and install the kirocrew-worker agent config.

        The SUPERSET of the default agent, which is the whole distinction worth
        keeping: everything the default agent already grants, plus the opt-in
        ``kirocrew-work`` server, plus a prompt carrying the reporting contract. A
        NARROWED worker spec was considered and rejected — a worker writes files, runs
        builds and drives git, so anything a narrowed spec withheld would be something
        some work item needs, which is the same defect an omitted ``agent`` on
        ``session_create`` produces by handing the child ``kirocrew-conductor``
        (no ``fs_write``, cannot do the work).

        "The default agent" is the spec ON DISK, not the template it was assembled
        from — :func:`_installed_default_spec` says why that difference is the whole
        point. The keys in :data:`_WORKER_MIRRORED_KEYS` are mirrored from it and the
        work server plus its two grants are added on top, so a server the user mounts,
        a grant they add and the model they pick all reach the worker on the next
        refresh, while a tool the ceiling withholds on the default stays withheld here.

    TWO things are SUBTRACTED rather than inherited, and both exist because the
        mirror would otherwise widen a worker's reach on its own. The cron grants in
        :data:`_WORKER_EXCLUDED_GRANTS` — a recurring job outlives the item, the session
        and the dispatch, so a worker does not auto-approve authoring one (see that
        constant for why those three verbs and not the reading ones, and why the tool
        stays mounted). And the servers :func:`_worker_unassignable_servers` names — an
        ``opt_in`` set is assigned per agent, so one the operator mounted on their own
        agent is not thereby assigned to every worker they dispatch. The whole spec is
        ``default + @kirocrew-work − cron scheduling − the opt-in sets nobody assigned
        here``.

        The spec is otherwise a FUNCTION of those inputs, and the previous worker file
        contributes exactly one field to it: a ``model`` the user froze with an explicit
        pick. Carrying anything else forward was tried and removed. The worker file is
        derived, so an entry in it is either a copy of the default's or the user's own and
        nothing on disk says which — and an add-only merge therefore resurrects a server
        the default has since DROPPED (register an app, deregister it, and its tools stay
        callable on the worker for good) while also re-admitting an ``autoApprove`` no
        ceiling has seen. Preserving a user's worker-file edits is worth doing, but it
        needs a provenance record this change does not introduce.

        ``work_brief`` and ``work_report`` are auto-approved because a worker that must
        ask permission to say it is blocked will not say it, and an unattended
        dispatch is exactly the case the ledger exists for. Every grant on the
        assembled list — template, mirror, preserved or added here — passes the
        governance ceiling in ONE final filter, so a host that governs a ref gets a
        prompt rather than a bypass.

    A dispatched, worker-shaped agent, but NOT the default-mirroring worker: it carries
    its own charter and its own tool surface, so it is built from scratch the way each
    conductor is rather than mirrored from the default spec. It authors ONE dashboard
    template and lands it as a pull request, so it mounts the two capabilities that work
    needs -- ``fs_write`` and ``execute_bash`` -- and nothing that would make it a
    conductor or a reporting worker: no ``session`` verb, no ``@kirocrew-work`` mount, no
    ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` publication surface, no ``code`` (governance classes it under
    ``filesystem.write``, a second path to two capabilities already mounted).

    ``fs_write`` and ``execute_bash`` are MOUNTED but never auto-approved, the line
    ``kirocrew-conductor`` draws and for the same reason: ``allowedTools`` has no argument
    matching, so a blanket write or shell grant cannot be told apart from "write anywhere"
    / "run anything", and the author's whole safety story is that a human reads its diff
    before it lands. Every auto-approved entry only READS or recalls -- the frontmatter
    ``allowedTools`` of the shipped ``agent-spec.md`` (``fs_read``, ``tool_search`` and the
    four read-only ``@kirocrew-core`` verbs) minus ``fs_read`` -- which is what makes
    granting it on the one path that never reaches the PreToolUse gate safe.

    Derived from the kirocrew agent so it inherits the resolved ``@kirocrew-core``
    invocation and the security hooks, then narrowed: the ``mcpServers`` map keeps only
    ``kirocrew-core`` (the one server any grant below names), and the KAS policy is
    derived from the FILTERED grant list rather than restated, so a ceiling that strips a
    grant strips its KAS rule with it. The shared writer version-gates it.

    The ``prompt``, ``description``, ``tools`` and ``allowedTools`` are ALL read from the
    shipped ``dashboard-template`` skill's ``agent-spec.md`` -- the one authoritative copy
    of the charter, which :func:`parse_markdown_spec` already parses from the package --
    rather than restated in Python literals that nothing holds equal to it. The
    frontmatter ``allowedTools`` is the SOURCE's authored auto-approve intent; the install
    drops ``fs_read`` from it (the one omission with a named reason below) and re-filters
    the rest through the governance ceiling, so what lands is the governed surface rather
