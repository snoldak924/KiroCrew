"""The governance refresh of crews' private template copies.

A fork of an owned template carries the template's machine plumbing and grants, so
every rebuild re-projects both onto it. The refresh runs under the settled event
:func:`kiro_crew.agent.require_fork_governance` waits on, and records every fork it
could not re-filter in :data:`_fork_refresh_failed`, which that gate refuses to start
a session on. The boot path defers the refresh to a thread
(:func:`refresh_after_rebuild`); the gate holds fork-backed spawns until it finishes.
