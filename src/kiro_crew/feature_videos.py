"""Feature videos — deterministic, one-shot feature-intro clips for the dashboard.

Sibling of :mod:`kiro_crew.tips`, and deliberately NOT built like it. A tip is
generated: the model picks a feature from a catalog and writes prose about it, so
the engine is a cadence gate plus a weighted-random selector over a pool that
changes every six hours. A video is a shipped artifact — a recorded clip with a
title and a poster — so nothing about it can be generated at request time, and
"which one do I show" has exactly one right answer for a given install state.

That makes ELIGIBILITY deterministic:

* the catalog is DATA, never generated at request time — a signed manifest
  published per release (:mod:`kiro_crew.feature_videos_manifest`), with the
  static tuple in this module (:data:`CATALOG`) as the fallback for an install
  that has never fetched one;
* "has the user already used this feature?" is answered by named probes
  (:data:`_PROBES` / :data:`_PARAM_PROBES`) that read local state, never by a
  model's guess;
* a clip is only offered once its media is actually on this machine — a bundled
  asset, or a hosted clip the background pass has downloaded and sha256-verified.
  Nothing the browser plays has bytes this gateway did not check first.

WHICH of several equally-eligible clips gets shown is RANDOM (:func:`select_next`).
Not because order starves a clip — it does not, since a verdict is permanent and
each launch retires the clip it showed, so a fixed order reaches the whole library
too. The draw is about the LIBRARY rather than one install: publication order is
the same for everyone, so a deterministic pick shows every install the same first
clip, and the newest entry is the last thing anybody sees. Drawing uniformly
spreads first impressions across the set, which is what makes early feedback on a
new clip arrive at all. Nothing about ELIGIBILITY is random, so a video the user
has retired, or one for a feature they already use, still cannot appear.

Both statuses a user can record (``seen`` / ``dismissed``) are PERMANENT. There
is no snooze, because a feature intro is not a recurring nudge: once it has been
watched or waved away, showing it again is noise.

Two source shapes reach a client, and :func:`validate_asset_path` is the one
gate for both: a bundled clip under ``/app-assets/feature-videos/`` and a cached
clip under ``/feature-videos/<release>/`` served from the data home. Both are
same-origin. There is deliberately no third shape: handing the browser a CDN url
would play bytes the sha256 pin never saw and follow redirects the gateway's own
opener refuses, so an uncached hosted clip is simply not offered until the
download pass has landed it. A verified manifest REPLACES the bundled catalog
(:func:`_offer_pool`), so on the launch where a manifest has arrived but no clip
has landed yet, nothing is offered: the download runs in the background, and the
next launch shows what it landed. That is the deliberate trade — one quiet launch,
never a clip whose bytes this gateway did not check.
