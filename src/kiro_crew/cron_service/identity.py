    ``--agent`` / the ``agent`` field is the one slot every create surface offers
    for naming either a provider template or a crew member. The dashboard's own UI
    resolves a member pick client-side and sends a separate ``member_id``; the CLI,
    the MCP ``cron_add`` tool and a scripted dashboard POST do not, so a member name
    arrives in ``agent_id`` and is captured as ``selection_kind='template'`` with the
    member name mistaken for a provider template -- which the cron chat's reply path
    then cannot resolve, failing to bind the agent on every reply.

    Resolve that split ONCE, here, so every entry point agrees: when ``member_id`` is
    not already given, defer the classification to the live resolver
    (:func:`kiro_crew.config.loader._resolve_agent_selection`) and read its result,
    rather than re-coding the precedence. The resolver checks the crew-member alias
    FIRST -- a name in ``config.agents`` is an alias hit regardless of whether a
    materialized provider template of the same name also exists -- so a member whose
    name also ships a ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json`` spec (e.g. ``kirocrew-conductor``)
    still classifies as a member, not a template. When the resolver reports an alias
    hit carrying a durable ``member_id`` we return it as the member (``agent_id``
    cleared, ``member_id`` set); a name that resolves to a bare provider template, and
    an explicit ``member_id`` the caller already resolved, are returned unchanged.

    This is a CREATE-only fix: it runs at the three create callers (CLI ``cron add``,
    MCP ``cron_add``, dashboard ``POST /api/crons``) that know the user just picked an
    agent. It leaves ``bind_cron_memory``'s record-level ``agent_id``-is-a-template
    contract untouched -- the promotion never happens inside ``add_job`` -- so editing
