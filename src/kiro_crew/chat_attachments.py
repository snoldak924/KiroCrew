"""Copy inline chat images into per-session storage as a message is persisted.

An agent shows a picture in chat by writing ``![alt](/abs/path.png)``, and the
dashboard resolves that path off disk AT VIEW TIME (``/api/file-raw``). Nothing
owns the file the markup names: agent screenshots land in the per-process
scratch dir (:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_scratch`), which is reclaimed as soon as the
agent process dies, so the image routinely outlives its own message by hours and
the transcript then renders a missing-file chip in its place, forever. The
renderer names this as the dominant failure it sees and can only decorate it --
by the time it looks, the bytes are gone.

An image a message references is SESSION-scoped content, like an artifact or an
outbox file: it must live and die with the session's history. So at the write
boundary -- where a message's text becomes a durable transcript row -- each
referenced local image is COPIED into a directory beside the transcript and the
persisted text is rewritten to point there.

Contract, stated once because two writers share it
(:meth:`kiro_crew.history.ConversationLog.append` for agent / channel / cron
rows, ``chat_persistence._build_message_entry`` for the dashboard slot save):

* **Copy, never move.** The original stays exactly where the agent put it. The
  caller decides what its own live row names afterwards (the dashboard slot save
  commits the rewritten destination into the row, see there); this function only
  returns the rewritten text.
* **Content-addressed.** The stored name carries a sha256 prefix of the bytes, so
  one image referenced by ten messages is stored once and a second reference
  costs a stat.
* **Idempotent.** A destination already inside the attachments directory costs
  no copy, which is what lets a re-persist of the same row (the slot save
  re-serializes its whole window on every flush) run without re-copying and lets
  the two writers compose in either order. Its destination is still re-ENCODED,
  so a row written by a build that spelled a Windows path natively is repaired
  the next time it is persisted; for a row already canonical the re-encode is
  byte-identical, which is what keeps the round trip a fixed point.
* **Fail-open, per image.** Anything unreadable, oversized, symlinked, or of an
  unexpected type keeps its original markup and logs at debug. A picture that
  cannot be preserved must never cost the message its text.
* **Bounded per message.** Both writers copy while holding the per-session lock,
  so one row's work has a ceiling on count and on total bytes -- see
  :data:`MAX_IMAGES_PER_MESSAGE`.
* **Local only.** ``http(s)``, ``data:`` and protocol-relative destinations are
  never touched -- they are already durable and are not ours to copy.

The SECURITY boundary on the read is one call to
:func:`kiro_crew.hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`, the house chokepoint for
"read a file an untrusted string named". It opens the final component AS ITSELF on
every platform (``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` where there is no
``O_NOFOLLOW``), then validates the descriptor it actually opened -- regular file,
not hardlinked, not sensitive -- so no check-to-use window remains. Nothing here
re-decides any of that, and the copy is written from the bytes that call returned.

The ``os.lstat`` ahead of it is CLASSIFICATION, not a second gate, and the
distinction is worth stating because the two look alike. The chokepoint canonicalizes
with ``realpath`` before it opens, so a destination that IS a symlink is read as its
target; refusing one is therefore a policy choice -- an attachment records a file, and
a link is a reference to someone else's, whose target the markup could have named
outright anyway. Being a lexical pre-check it is inherently racy, and that costs
nothing: losing the race yields a read the chokepoint still fully validates.

The attachments directory sits under the crew data home's ``sessions/``
directory, which is WRITE-protected but deliberately not read-sensitive (see
``security.paths._WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS``) -- so ``/api/file-raw`` serves an
attachment with no change to its sensitive-path policy, and the gateway's own
persistence writes there through direct calls that never route through the agent
file-edit gate.

Reclamation is DELETE-ONLY, deliberately. Transcript rotation moves old rows to
``archive/`` (:func:`kiro_crew.history._archive_lines`) and those rows still name
their attachments, so rotation orphans nothing and must not sweep -- a sweep
against the live transcript alone would break exactly the references the archive
keeps. An attachment becomes genuinely unreferenced only when archive retention
expires its last row. The ceilings here are PER MESSAGE; across messages a
session grows with every distinct image until it is deleted (a per-session
ceiling or a retention-coupled sweep is a tracked follow-up). Session delete
takes the directory in three all-or-nothing steps -- rename it aside, unlink the
transcript, purge the staged copy -- so a retained transcript never points at
pictures already gone (see :func:`stage_attachments_removal`).

Everything here is blocking file I/O; callers on the event loop must offload it.

    r"""*new_dest* with a Windows path's separators written as ``/``.

    A destination is re-parsed by a CommonMark parser before anything resolves
    it, and CommonMark drops a backslash that precedes ASCII punctuation. The
    attachments directory sits under the data home, whose default is
    ``~/.kiro/crew``, so a native destination always carries ``\.kiro\`` -- the
    parser reads that ``\.`` as an escaped dot, and the dashboard then asks
    ``/api/file-raw`` for ``...\Users\me.kiro\crew\...``, which is not the file.
    Windows accepts ``/`` in every file API, so the forward-slash spelling names
    the same file and is a fixed point of the parser's rule.

    Not a new convention: this is what the frontend producer of this wire format
    already emits (``mdImageDest``/``normalizeWindowsPath``,
    ``website/src/utils/fileTokens.ts``), and the forward-slash drive spelling is
    what its consumer admits (``WINDOWS_ABS_PATH_RE``,
    ``website/src/utils/urlTransform.ts``) -- where the backslash UNC spelling is
    deliberately REFUSED, so ``//host/share/...`` is the only form in which a UNC
    attachment can render at all.

    The Python-side readers are unaffected: ``is_unc_shape`` accepts either
    separator, ``Path`` treats them alike on Windows, and ``_same_dir`` compares
    through ``os.path.normpath``. A POSIX path matches nothing here and is
    returned by identity.
