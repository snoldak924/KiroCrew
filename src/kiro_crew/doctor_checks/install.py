    An installed skill can run for days against a package that has already fixed

    gate compares mtimes, so an installed copy whose mtime is newer than
    anything the package ships is judged up to date and simply skipped; the

    A shipped file cannot answer this about itself. It has no import-time

    constant goes stale silently the moment someone edits the file without
    bumping it -- the exact failure it would claim to prevent. Currency is a

    relation is visible from inside the script. Doctor sees both sides.

    Scope is deliberately narrow. "Behind" means the install does not match the

    doctor makes no network call, and an operator running an older build must not
