"""The structured attachment list a channel hands to the provider with a prompt.

An image reaches the model as an ACP image block ONLY when the receiving
channel says the user attached one: the dashboard's upload list, a Slack or
Discord file, a Telegram photo. The prompt TEXT is never scanned for image
paths -- see :func:`kiro_crew.acp.prompt_blocks.build_prompt_blocks`, which
builds its image blocks from this list alone.

Why the list is structured rather than inferred from the text: a path in text is
a mention, not an upload. The session ledger's ``artifact <name>: <path>.png``
snapshot line rides in every nudge cycle; a nudge body, an injected envelope, an
agent's own ``![shot](...png)`` reply quoted back and a consolidation prompt all
name files the user never attached to THIS message. Inlining a mention re-sends
the file, and because the backend replays every stored image block, a screenshot
named in a per-cycle snapshot grows the request by its full encoded size on every
turn until the backend rejects the body. Only the channel that received a file
knows the user attached it, so only the channel may say so.

A near-leaf module: it is imported by the ACP prompt builder, by
``kiro_crew.messaging`` (which the builder must not import back) and by the
dashboard runner, so it reaches only the file, image and platform helpers, and
the raster sniff is imported inside the predicate because the messaging package
imports this module while initialising.
