"""CLI doctor subcommand — verify Kiro Crew setup and diagnose issues.

:func:`_doctor` is the orchestrator: it prints the report's sections in one fixed
order, threads one ``issues`` list through them, and turns that list into the
closing verdict and the exit status. Most sections live in the
:mod:`kiro_crew.doctor_checks` families. Two kinds of row stay here.

The rows the orchestrator composes itself: the Platform edition and jail rows it
reads off the context ``cli.main`` could not compose, and the Dependencies, Agent,
Runtime and Connectivity rows it builds from the values it threads onward.

The rows repository gates pin to this file:

* the probes that spawn a process or run an event loop, keyed by
  ``cli_doctor.py::<function>`` in ``test/test_spawn_audit.py`` -- the host probes
  below, the MCP Tools probe, and the node, venv-interpreter and
  ``kiro-cli --version`` rows ``_doctor`` spawns itself;
* the agent-spec reads ``test/test_agent_spec_hardened_reads.py`` inventories for
  this file: the Model section, the model-pin audit and MCP Governance;
* the MCP Tools repair, whose revoke ``test/test_app_mcp_scoping.py`` reads from this
  module's source;
* the KAS relay rows, whose ACP imports ``.github/agent-sdk-boundary-baseline.txt``
  counts for this file;
* the embedding-model URL probe, whose redactor call ``security_posture`` registers
  under this file.

This module is also the doctor's one patch target. A family reads every function,
class and value this module binds through this module at call time (a module is one
shared object, so a family imports it directly; a section that imported a name inside
its own body keeps doing so), and every family section stays reachable here under its
old name, with a write forwarded to the family (see the facade at the end of this
module).

    entry is deliberately omitted from every emitted spec — and retracted from
    an existing one on refresh — so on such a host the entry's absence is the
    HEALTHY state, not a broken install. Doctor's static checks must consult
    the same predicate or the two sides drift apart, producing the unfixable
    "missing from mcpServers (re-run `kirocrew setup`)" loop on every host
    where the gate is closed. Resolving the gate through the registry
    keeps them pinned together: a future server gaining a gate needs no edit
    here, and a server without one reports open, exactly as emission treats it.

    The ``except`` covers gate-CONTRACT failures only — a registry entry that
    is not a dict, or a gate callable that raises past its own handling. For
    those, the fail direction is deliberately the OPPOSITE of emission's
    ``agent._gated_off_servers()``: there, a gate that raises is treated as
    closed, because the open position hands out a backend the operator may not
    want running; here it reports NOT closed, because "closed" is what
    silences the missing-entry error. Each side fails toward its own safe
    state. Note the scope honestly: the shipped computer-use gate catches its
    own internal errors and ANSWERS ``False`` (its documented fail-closed
    posture — an unreadable keystone must never hand out the desktop), so an
    unreadable keystone is indistinguishable from policy-closed through the
    boolean, by the gate's own design. That answer is still the
    emission-CONSISTENT one to report: in that state the entry genuinely is
    omitted from every emitted spec, so the ℹ️ line describes what the system
    actually does, even when the underlying cause is a broken enable-state
    read rather than a decision.

    Never loads a native driver: the computer-use gate reads only the enable
    keystone and platform flags (see ``agent._computer_use_spec_gate``), which
    is what makes it safe to evaluate on doctor's diagnostic path.

# ── The facade ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every section that no repository gate pins to this file lives in a
# ``kiro_crew.doctor_checks`` family. The names this module held before the
# sections moved stay reachable here; a section extracted from ``_doctor`` by that
# move never lived here and is patched on its family. Two properties keep the
# moved names true:
#
# 1. A read here answers with the object the family holds, resolved on each
#    access, so there is no second copy to drift from it.
# 2. Setting the attribute HERE reaches the family. A section calls its own
#    helpers through its own globals, so a patch that landed only on this module
#    would leave the section running the unpatched helper -- the test passes
#    while testing nothing. ``_ReExportModule`` below forwards the write.
#
# Both halves resolve the family from ``sys.modules`` on each access, importing it
# only on a miss, so a purged and re-imported family is seen at once. The
# names this module binds itself -- the imports above and the sections defined
# here -- are not in the table; a family reads those through this module
# (``cli_doctor.config_dir()``), which is what keeps a patch here reaching them.
# A module the doctor imports is one shared object in every family, so patch its
# attributes (``cli_doctor.sandbox.detect_backend``) rather than rebinding it.
# ``mock.patch(..., create=True)`` must not target a name in the table: its undo
# deletes the family's binding.

#: Re-exported name -> the dotted name of the family module that DEFINES it.
