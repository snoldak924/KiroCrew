    The generic superset the three narrow bounds miss: a self-wake cycle that

    spent, a persistent tool error, a prompt timeout -- rather than one of the
    specific deterministic rejections, approval stalls or never-got-a-session
    streaks that already have their own stand-down. Called from BOTH terminal
    arms (an ``AcpError`` and the generic ``except Exception`` that catches the
    ``AcpRuntimeError`` timeout family and plain errors), which is why this is a
    helper and not an inline block: a report in only one arm would miss whichever
    death the other serves, and the gate below -- the part with the regression
    risk -- is then tested once instead of twice.

    The gate, in the one place it is defined:

    * ``self_wake`` -- only the loop's OWN delivered cycle counts; a human turn
      that happened to error on a slot that also carries a loop must not spend
      the loop's stand-down budget. Same marker ``_note_cycle_start_failure``
      relies on.
    * NOT a session-start failure -- that has its own streak
      (``notify_cycle_start_failed``); the ``session_start_failed`` tag is read
      with ``getattr`` because the two ACP families carry it independently.
    * NOT a structural rejection -- that is one deterministic turn with its own
      terminal stop (``structural_terminal`` tag); counting it here would
      double-charge the same fault.
    * NOT a pre-dispatch fault -- a memory store that would not open
      (``memory_unavailable``) or a member agent file changed out of band
      (``materialization_changed``) never reached a session at all, so the
      "reached a session and then died" stand-down (and the operator notice that
      names a backend/tool/timeout cause) must not fire for them. Identified by
      the already-resolved row meta, so no new classification is needed. A plain
      internal bug is NOT excluded: a self-wake cycle that dispatches and raises
      the same bug every interval is exactly the no-progress waste this bound
      ends.

    Scoped to the fired loop by BOTH its id (``loop_id``) AND its config
    generation (``expected_generation``), captured at fire time, so neither a
    stale completion of a since-revised loop (A->B->A) nor a stale completion of
    a loop since REPLACED by a fresh one on the same slot and generation can
    charge the loop live on the slot now -- the same ``(id, generation)`` fence
    the structural verdict uses. The service matches both under its lock.

    Awaited, not fire-and-forget: the service records the charge and awaits its
    durable write before this returns, so the stand-down never reads a count the
    store has not accepted. This is possible because the terminal arm is async;
    the sync turn-lifecycle hooks that reassign a deadline cannot await and keep
    their detached write. Best-effort: a monitoring convenience never changes how
    this turn is reported, so any failure here is swallowed.
