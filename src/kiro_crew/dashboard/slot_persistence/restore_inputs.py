"""The reads and screens a restore makes before it builds a slot.

Most of this is disk work or a pure screen that touches no slot state, which is
what lets the async restore drivers run it on a worker thread: the agent-to-model
map, the restore config, the open-tab snapshot and its key screen, the committed
agent choice, the delete-during-read witness, the app-owned channel-row screen and
the recent-session key map. The MCP-app claim recovery pairs its spool read with
the in-memory apply that follows a build. The drivers, the prefetch helpers and the
slot builders stay in ``chat_persistence``.

New restore-time reads and screens belong here.

    does not have: ``ConversationLog.delete_session``
    leaves **no tombstone** — its own docstring notes that once the delete
    releases the lock "a concurrent writer can recreate the session" — so a slot
    published from content we already hold rewrites, on its next flush, a file
    the user permanently deleted. The dashboard's HTTP listener is bound before
    startup restore runs (``_start_site`` precedes it in ``start_dashboard``), so
    a user delete really can land inside this window.

    This is the guard the chat-resume handler already applies after its own read
    for exactly this reason; the logic is mirrored here rather than reinvented, so
    both surfaces refuse on the same evidence.

    MUST be called synchronously, on the loop, with no suspension point between
    it and the build it gates — an await in between would reopen the window it
    closes.

    Two arms, and the asymmetry in each is deliberate:

    * **absence** — ``get_metadata_status``, never ``get_metadata``: the latter
      returns ``{}`` for both "deleted" and "unreadable", and reading an
      unreadable metadata line as a deletion would discard a LIVE session. On an
      unreadable read this returns ``None`` (build), because refusing is the
      destructive direction here.
    * **identity** — the delete leaves no tombstone, so a delete-then-RECREATE
      inside the window leaves a NON-EMPTY metadata dict belonging to a NEW
      conversation. Existence alone reads that as "still here" and would publish
      a slot holding the OLD transcript, whose flush overwrites a session the
      user is actively using — worse than the first arm, because the data
      destroyed is live. ``created_at`` is the discriminator: every path that
      MINTS a metadata line stamps it, while a rewrite/compaction carries it
      through verbatim, so this does not fire on a legitimate rewrite.

    ``created_at`` ABSENT on either side falls through to building rather than
    refusing: refusing would reject every transcript whose metadata predates the
    field, a visible break for real users, to close a narrow race.

    The existence witness is the UNION of the pre-read metadata and the
    transcript, so a metadata-only session (a metadata line with no messages,
    which ``update_metadata`` creates on upsert) is not silently unguarded.
