    A persisted row can differ from its window copy by exactly the redaction

    applies it symmetrically. A restore redacts on load while keeping ``ts``
    verbatim (``chat_persistence.py:708-709``), so the window holds the redacted
    text; a save redacts every non-user role on the way out
    (``chat_persistence.py:1282-1284``) while the window keeps it verbatim
    (``state.py:2107``), so in a session that was never restored the DISK holds the
    redacted text instead. Redacting one side only cannot converge on that second
    pair — redacting an already-redacted body just reproduces it — so the row reads
    as un-flushed and the persisted suffix is appended twice.

    Applying the transform is also what separates a persisted row from a foreign
    row that merely shares a ``ts``: on a coarse clock two writers flooring off the
    same previous row both emit ``previous + 1µs`` (``history.py:1179-1219``), so
    matching on ``ts`` alone treats an unrelated row as the window's own and drops
    an un-flushed message from a response the client uses as a replacement.

    Two bodies can redact to the same text while being different messages, so the
    redaction-equivalent branch ALSO requires the stamps to match. That costs the
    legitimate case nothing: this branch only ever fires for a row and its own
    persisted copy, which differ by the transform precisely because one side was
    redacted, and both the save and the load copy ``ts`` verbatim
    (``chat_persistence.py:1288`` and ``:714``). A foreign row whose credential
    merely redacts to the same text carries its own writer's stamp, so it does not
    consume the window row.

    The requirement is on this branch ALONE, which is why it does not reintroduce
    the duplication above. A durable injection is byte-identical to its window row,
    so it returns at the plain-equality check and never reaches here — and that pair
    genuinely does carry different stamps, because the two writers mint

    """Append window messages that are not yet on disk to a chained disk read.

    ``all_msgs`` is a disk read, so it omits transient roles while the window
    retains them, and it spans any older sessions a chained read walks. Sizing the
    tail by subtracting the two lengths therefore mixes units AND measures the
    whole file: it both re-appends rows the disk read already returned and lets a
    row from another writer consume a turn that is still owed.

    Takes the window itself rather than a caller-supplied count, so a caller cannot
    pass a length captured before an ``await``; the window can grow while a threaded
    disk read is in flight. ``snapshot`` is the one safe way to supply it: a
    ``(disk_older_count, window)`` PAIR from ``_snapshot_slot_window`` captured on
    the event loop AFTER the disk read, which is consistent by construction and
    cannot observe a mid-finalization window. Passing no snapshot falls back to
    capturing inside this thread, which is weaker — see that helper.

    Prefer message identity. A save copies each window row's ``meta.mid`` to disk,
    so a window row whose id appears in the disk read is persisted. A durable
    injector passes the window row's own id to ``ConversationLog.append``, which
    persists it in the same ``meta.mid`` shape — that copy carrying the id is the
    point: it IS the window row's flushed form and must match. A writer that passes
    no id persists no ``meta``, so its rows cannot be mistaken for a flushed window
    row.

    A disk read holding no ids at all needs a different boundary: a session
    persisted before ids existed, or rows a durable injector appended without
    going through a save. Walk the window and the disk read forward TOGETHER and
    stop at the first row that is not accounted for. A row from another writer no
    longer ENDS the run, which is what sizing the boundary as
    ``len(all_msgs) - slot._disk_older_count`` did — that measures the whole file,
    so a foreign append walked one row too far and dropped the owed turn. Both
    estimators the slot already carries are wrong here for opposite reasons: that
    subtraction over-counts, and ``_disk_window_len`` is not advanced by an
    injector, so it under-counts and would re-append a persisted row.

    The window is matched against the disk region as an ordered SUBSEQUENCE: a row
    that does not match the window row under consideration is SKIPPED rather than
    treated as the end of the window. The save is non-destructive against a
    cross-process append and merges the preserved rows back in TIME order
    (``_interleave_foreign_lines``), so the region can read
    ``[window, foreign, window]`` and an unmatched row means "not mine", not "end of
    window". Ending the run there leaves every persisted row after it in the tail,
    which appends an already-persisted suffix a second time.

    Skipping cannot pass over a row that should have matched: both sequences are
    chronological — the save's merge preserves each side's internal order — so a
    later window row's persisted copy cannot precede the current row's. It is also
    bounded: the disk cursor only ever moves forward, so the scans total
    O(window + region), and the first window row with no match anywhere in the
    remaining region ends the walk, which is the genuine end of the flushed prefix.

    A row matches on role plus content, compared through the redaction transform
    on both sides (``_same_persisted_body``). A shared ``ts`` is never SUFFICIENT —
    on a coarse clock two writers flooring off the same previous row both emit
    ``previous + 1µs`` (``history.py:1179-1219``), so accepting it alone drops an
    un-flushed message — but it is REQUIRED on the redaction-equivalent branch,
    where the only legitimate pair is a row and its own copy and the stamp is
    carried through verbatim.

    Ids are counted over the on-disk WINDOW REGION only,
    ``all_msgs[slot._disk_older_count:]``. The rows before that are the frozen prefix
    — on-disk rows older than the window, so none of them is in ``slot.messages``.
    Counting them would let an occurrence that exists only in the prefix fund a match
    for a window row that was never flushed, and the boundary would then walk past it.
    The fallback below already starts its disk cursor at the same offset.

    Id matching is selected only when EVERY row in that region carries a valid id, not
    merely when some row does. The dual-write injectors stamp both copies with one id
    (``slot.append`` mints it for the window copy and ``append_if_absent`` persists it
    on the durable copy), but the region can still legitimately hold a MIX: transcripts
    written before ids existed, and callers that pass no id. Choosing id matching on the
    strength of one id-carrying
    row then applies it to a row that structurally cannot match, which reads as
    un-flushed and appends the injection a second time. A mixed region belongs on the
    ordered path, which compares the fields both writers do record.

    Ids are matched as a MULTISET, one disk occurrence consumed per window row, not
    as a set. ``meta`` on an inbound message is caller-supplied and an id is minted
    only when one is *absent*, so a caller can post the same id twice. A set then
    matches EVERY window row carrying that id, so the boundary walks past a row that
    was never persisted and the response omits it — the silent-loss direction. One
    disk row is enough for that; two disk rows sharing an id are not required.
    Consuming an occurrence bounds the match to as many rows as really reached disk,
    and the earliest window row is the persisted one because flushes follow window
    order.

    Only string ids are matched. A truthy non-string ``mid`` survives to disk for the
    same caller-supplied reason and would raise ``TypeError`` if hashed.

    The id path selects the owed rows by MEMBERSHIP rather than by a prefix
    boundary. A boundary assumes every persisted row precedes every un-flushed one.
    When it does not, a later match moves the boundary past an un-flushed row and
    the response omits it — a drop, which is worse than the duplication this
    function exists to prevent. Ending the walk at the first miss is not the
    remedy either: a transient row is dropped by the save and so can never match,
    and stopping there re-appends every persisted row after it. Rows the client does
    not need are skipped outright (``_UNOWED_WINDOW_ROLES``), so selecting by
    membership cannot surface one the boundary happened to exclude; a pending
    ``permission`` row is deliberately not among them. Because an id in
    the disk window region proves that row reached disk, the owed set is simply the
    rows whose id did not, kept in window order. Where the persisted rows really
    are a prefix this returns the same answer, so it is a strict generalisation.

        #
        #   1. A TRANSIENT role. A disk read omits transient roles entirely, so such a
        #      row can NEVER be matched and is ALWAYS owed. Only ``_UNOWED_WINDOW_ROLES``
        #      (``done``/``queued``) and an already-answered ``permission`` are genuinely
        #      not owed.
        #   2. A non-transient row the forward scan does not find on disk. Breaking the
        #      loop outright on such a row is wrong: it leaves ``start`` pointing AT the
        #      unmatched row, so ``window[start:]`` re-emits every LATER window row --
        #      including rows already on disk. With a stop_event flushed before reply
        #      finalization (``_flush_segment`` re-appends the stop AFTER the finalized
        #      assistant row, see the note at the top of this function) the window reads
        #      ``[... unflushed reply, flushed stop]``: the reply misses, the loop breaks,
        #      and the persisted stop comes back a second time and out of order -- the
        #      very duplication this function exists to remove.
        #
        # The sibling id-carrying arm above already has the right rule, so mirror it
        # rather than inventing a second one: an unmatched row is held, a later match
        # flushes what is held at ITS disk position, and leftovers stay in the tail.
        # That keeps owed rows in window order instead of after the whole disk slice.
        #
        # Nothing is emitted twice: ``start`` only advances on a match, and a match flushes
        # ``owed_rows`` first, so every flushed row had an index below ``start``. Whatever
        # is left over sits at or after ``start`` and is carried by the trailing slice --
