/**
 * Evidence for the "N tabs were not restored" notice on the chat pane.
 *
 * THE CHANGE: a tab the gateway's startup restore listed and could not rebuild
 * used to leave no trace a person could see. The session was intact, nothing was
 * closed and nothing was deleted, so the sidebar simply had fewer rows than
 * before the restart -- the only way to notice was to remember what used to be
 * there. This notice is that trace, and its link is the remedy.
 *
 * The scene mounts the REAL `UnrestoredTabsNotice` from `src/` against the real
 * stylesheet, theme tokens and live i18n catalog, so the band in the frame is
 * the component's own render and its sentence comes from the catalog through
 * `i18nT` -- a frame also proves the new plural keys resolve. Nothing here
 * re-implements the notice, its classes or its strings.
 *
 * `fetch` is stubbed rather than the api module so the component's real arrival
 * read runs and answers exactly what the new endpoint answers.
 *
 *   ?theme=dark|light&count=<n>
