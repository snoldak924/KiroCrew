/**
 * Screenshot harness for "New conversation" on a crewmate's DM (#16339).
 *
 * The control is the LAST row of the crewmate's profile card, in the theme's
 * danger colour — not a thread-header button (reviewer's call: the one occasion
 * anybody reaches for it is a crewmate stuck in a turn). The states a reviewer
 * has to judge:
 *
 *   01  the row, last on the Profile tab, red label
 *   02  the confirm dialog — what is forgotten, what survives, and that a
 *       running turn is stopped first
 *   03  the thread after the reset: the discarded rows behind
 *       "Show earlier messages", the fresh thread's own hint below it
 *   04  the same thread with the earlier messages revealed
 *   05  the row still AVAILABLE while the crewmate is working, which is the
 *       whole reason it moved here
 *   06  the row held with its spinner while the stop-and-wait runs
 *   12  a turn that outlasts the stop budget: the route's own 409, under the row
 *
 * Runs the REAL built SPA behind `serveDist` with every `/api/**` answered from
 * fixtures (`stubDashboardApi`): no gateway, no auth, no kiro-cli. The boundary
 * is served the way production serves it — on the roster row's own `roster`
 * projection block — so what the pane draws here is what it draws live.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-16339-new-conversation.mjs [outDir]
