/**
 * Evidence for the archive count on the backup row (issue #8000): the ledger
 * keeps ONE run per kind, so a second nightly overwrites the first while both
 * archives stay in the drive -- and a row reading only that record reports one
 * archive for a prefix holding several.
 *
 * Runs against a Vite dev server with every /api/** call answered from
 * fixtures -- no gateway, no credentials, no real AWS.
 *
 *   01-count-line          snapshot has 4 recorded archives behind its one run
 *                          line, so the count line renders; sessions has one
 *                          archive behind one run and carries NO second line
 *   02-archive-list-open   the count line clicked: the stored-archive
 *                          disclosure it opens is the surface that can say what
 *                          the drive holds
 *   03-never-backed-up     a kind with no run at all and one recorded archive:
 *                          the meta line reads "no run recorded here, archives
 *                          may still be on the drive" rather than the bare "not
 *                          backed up yet" that would contradict the count line
 *                          (#13566 item 2). The frame-03 assertion resolves the
 *                          clause from the SELECTED locale's catalog, so a
 *                          non-English run checks that language's string.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/capture-backup-remembered-archives.mjs <devServerBase> [outDir] [lang] [theme]
