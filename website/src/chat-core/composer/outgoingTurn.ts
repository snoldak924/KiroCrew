/**
 * The outgoing turn: what one composer submit puts on the wire and in the
 * transcript (chat-core RFC §3 layer 4, P3-c).
 *
 * A composer holds more than its text: staged files, `@rel/` folder tokens,
 * collapsed `[ Paste #N ]` tokens and their blocks, dropped session
 * references, a picked knowledge block, a quoted message. Each becomes part of
 * the message in one fixed order, and this module is the one place that order
 * is written down, for every host that submits:
 *
 *   1. staged files: images become leading `![image](path)` lines, other files
 *      `[attached_file N] path` markers (`prepareSendPayload`);
 *   2. folder tokens: `@rel/` becomes `[attached_dir N] /abs/path` on the wire
 *      while the bubble keeps the token for its chip, and `meta.dirs[N-1]` is
 *      marker N's path (send only). Absolute, so the reference survives a
 *      cwd/project mismatch and history replay; after the file pass, which is
 *      disjoint because a file token never ends in `/`;
 *   3. session references: a link per reference, appended to both texts (send
 *      only) -- deliberately a POINTER, never the referenced transcript, which
 *      would spend a large share of this session's context window in one turn
 *      and can trip autocompact. The agent follows the link through a read
 *      path that is bounded, redacted and incognito-refusing server-side. The
 *      link is the session menu's "Copy link" string, and appending (never
 *      splicing) leaves earlier paste-token ranges untouched;
 *   4. collapsed pastes: each token whose block is staged AND whose token is
 *      still in the text expands on the wire; the bubble keeps the token and
 *      `meta.pastes` carries the blocks so it draws a chip. On a send the
 *      bubble text decides which tokens are live, so a block whose token left
 *      the text expands nowhere, not even inside a file or folder marker whose
 *      path happens to spell its token. On the text-only channel the wire is
 *      the only text, so a token there counts wherever it stands;
 *   5. a knowledge block opens the wire text (send only);
 *   6. a quoted message opens both texts, so the bubble's card can strip
 *      exactly what was sent. Last, so it stays the very first thing in the
 *      text: the bubble strips the block only from position 0
 *      (`stripQuoteBlock`), and a knowledge block in front of it would leave
 *      the card AND the raw block on screen.
 *
 * The order is the contract. Folder and paste passes run before anything is
 * prepended, and pasted content expands after the file and folder passes, so
 * pasted, quoted or knowledge text is never read as one of this turn's tokens.
 *
 * `'steer'` is the text-only channel (a mid-turn steer, the side chat): no
 * folder serialization (a marker with no `meta.dirs` to replay against would
 * truncate a spaced path, while the raw `@rel/` token stays correct under
 * replay -- serialize there only if that transport ever carries attachment
 * metadata), no session links or knowledge, and the bubble IS the wire text,
 * since nothing travels beside it to re-collapse a paste.
 *
 * Pure: no store, no side effect. The paste side-table write the bubble needs
 * on history load is returned as `storedPaste` for the host to perform.
