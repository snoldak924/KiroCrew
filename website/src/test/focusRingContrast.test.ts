/**
 * Every keyboard focus cue painted from the theme token sheets must clear WCAG
 * 1.4.11 (non-text contrast, 3:1) against the surfaces it is drawn on -- in
 * EVERY theme. See issue #4428.
 *
 * A focus ring below 3:1 leaves a keyboard or screen-reader user unable to see
 * where focus sits (WCAG 2.4.7 is served by the ring EXISTING;
 * focusVisibleRing.test.ts guards that -- 1.4.11 is the separate requirement
 * that it be PERCEIVABLE once it exists). The house ring is the theme `--accent`,
 * and `--accent` is deliberately NOT a token with a contrast contract: it falls
 * below 3:1 against `--bg` in three light palettes (rosepine-light 2.60,
 * everforest-light 2.81, intellij-light 2.92) and lower against the accent-tinted
 * completion-card fill (2.39 / 2.56 / 2.66). So the identity hue cannot carry the
 * minimum, and each focus mechanism pairs the accent with an opaque neutral layer
 * that does -- `--text-strong` for the accent rings, a `--text`-derived mix for
 * the neutral settings-search ring. THIS FILE measures that opaque layer.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED: the opaque contrast-carrying layer of each OPT-IN focus
 * mechanism in index.css --
 *   - the `.focus-ring` primitive's innermost `box-shadow` layer,
 *   - the shared `.focus-ring-accent` / `.focus-ring-accent-inset` / `-gap`
 *     utilities,
 *   - the `.settings-search .focus-ring` neutral ring.
 * The GLOBAL `:focus-visible` rule is outline-only (accent, the identity layer)
 * and carries no hairline, so there is nothing to measure there: a global
 * box-shadow hairline would survive the house `outline-hidden` opt-out and paint
 * a hard box on opted-out elements, so the hairline is opt-in only.
 * The ACCENT band in each is NOT asserted against the floor: it is the identity
 * layer and is allowed to be whatever hue the theme chose. Requiring the opaque
 * layer to clear the floor is what makes the ring perceptible regardless of the
 * accent's own contrast.
 *
 * TWO BACKDROPS: a focused control sits on the page (`--bg`) or inside the
 * accent-tinted completion card (`--accent` at 10% composited over `--bg`), which
 * is the surface that first surfaced this issue. Which one a given call site
 * lands on is a fact this file cannot read, so the floor is required against both.
 *
 * Machinery is shared, not re-derived: the WCAG math comes from `lib/iconContrast`
 * and the palette cascade from `./themePalette`, the single resolver this file
 * shares with scrollbarThumbContrast.test.ts and themeFillForeground.test.ts.
 *
 * SCOPE: built-in palettes only. A theme pack installed from a folder or created
 * in the theme editor supplies its own tokens at runtime and is out of reach of a
 * source-text measurement.
