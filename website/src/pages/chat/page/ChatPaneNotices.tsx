/**
 * Sentence for the unresumable-resume notice, built from the raw facts the chat
 * slice records (#5925).
 *
 * The slice stores `{ key, title, surface, reason }` rather than a finished
 * string because a reducer cannot localize: the label for a session's origin is
 * derived from its KEY, and that derivation lives at the render site. Keyed on
 * the stored key alone, because the resume being narrated often came from
 * another surface entirely (the command palette, a notification) whose row is
 * nowhere in this page's lists.
 *
 * `reason: 'failed'` gets its own sentence: nothing was resumed, so there is no
 * surface to name, and telling the user it "belongs to" somewhere would be a
 * guess.
 *
 * For `reason: 'surface'` the label is resolved, never interpolated raw. The
 * wire `surface` is a MACHINE value (`member`, `subagent`), so dropping it into
 * localized copy renders lowercase machine vocabulary mid-sentence -- and its
 * empty case reads "it's a Session session". So: the localized dashboard label
 * for a dashboard key, the channel label for a channel key, the surface
 * registry's own label when the mode is a registered surface, and otherwise a
 * sentence that names no surface at all -- and does not say "surface" either,
 * which is vocabulary a user meets only in settings prose.
 *
 * The registry lookup depends on `surfaces/builtins` having been imported (it
 * registers by module side effect, from `App.tsx`), which always holds wherever
 * this page renders. A miss degrades to the surface-free sentence rather than to
 * a wrong label, so the coupling cannot produce a lie.
 *
 * The message keys moved to this namespace with the notice; #3640's string said
 * "from the chat sidebar", which names a surface three of the four resume entry
 * points never touch. The two label keys stay under `pages.chatSidebar.*`
 * because the sidebar's own row still renders them.

/**
 * "N tabs were not restored", with the way to get them back.
 *
 * The user-visible half of #18252. A tab that the startup restore listed but
 * could not show leaves no other trace a person can see: the session is intact,
 * nothing was closed and nothing was deleted, so the sidebar simply has fewer
 * rows than it did before the restart, and the only way to notice was to
 * remember what used to be there.
 *
 * `?history=1` is the remedy rather than a reopen button, and deliberately so.
 * The keys are still in the reopen seed, so the next restart may well bring them
 * back on its own -- what the user needs NOW is the pane that lists every session
 * by name, which is the one place a tab can be identified and reopened. That pane
 * already answers the param on arrival, so pointing at it costs no new mechanism.
 *
 * Its own component because it owns a fetch: a hook called in the parent would
 * run on every chat page render whether or not a notice was ever shown.
