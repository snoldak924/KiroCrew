/**
 * How many tabs this gateway's startup restore listed but could not show.
 *
 * Read through `useQuery` rather than a hand-rolled `useEffect` fetch, so the
 * request inherits the shared retry ladder. The dashboard is commonly served
 * through a fronting proxy that answers a burst with HTTP 429; a manual fetch
 * swallows that and the notice is simply absent, which is the one outcome a
 * notice about silent data loss must not have.
 *
 * It also keeps asking until the restore ANSWERS. The restore runs after the
 * gateway starts serving, so a browser that arrives early reads `reported: false`
 * -- a real state, distinct from "nothing was dropped", and one that resolves on
 * its own within seconds. Polling stops the moment an answer arrives. A gateway
 * restart is the other way the answer changes: the new process runs its own
 * restore, so a WebSocket reconnect re-asks once.
 *
 * `0` covers both "nothing was dropped" and "no answer yet". They are different
 * facts on the wire (`reported`) and deliberately collapse here: the only consumer
 * is a notice, and a notice has nothing to say in either case.
 *
 * Dismissal lives in `sessionStorage`: a reload inside the same browser tab must
 * not re-raise a notice the user already answered, while a genuinely new browser
 * session is a new arrival and asks again.
