/**
 * Crew Members — one durable, pinned DM thread per crew member.
 *
 * CAPTURED: Settings > Developer > Feature Previews shows a screenshot of this
 * page in its "See what it looks like" dialog. A visible change here makes that
 * picture stale — re-shoot with `scripts/capture-feature-previews.mjs`.
 *
 * While no thread is open the page shows the full roster. Once a thread opens,
 * the roster folds into `CrewmateSwitcher` in the header and the conversation
 * receives that width. The centred identity pill opens `CrewProfilePanel`: an
 * in-flow 34% column while SidePanel is closed, or a rounded hover card centred
 * over the remaining thread width while SidePanel is open or on a phone. The
 * shared avatar moves between pill and card.
 *
 * The chat SidePanel has two standing entries here: the crewmate's generated
 * Dashboard and the workspace-scoped Files browser. Side Chat remains dynamic.
 * Profile owns Notes, Schedules, driven Sessions and browser-local Goals.
 * Configuration still writes through CrewEditorDialog.
 *
 * Identity is the exact CREW NAME, never the slug: slugification is lossy
 * (`Oncall` and `oncall` share a slug and therefore one thread directory),
 * so rows are keyed and selected by name, and a thread-open response whose
 * `member` is a DIFFERENT name is surfaced as a collision instead of being
 * silently mounted (first-bound-wins is the backend contract).
 *
 * The pin is a server-side property of member slots (born only through
 * POST /api/members/{slug}/thread). It is an invariant of every member
 * thread, so the UI does not announce it — there is no unpinned state to
 * contrast against.
 *
 * Which crewmate is open rides the URL (`?member=<name>`). A visit that names
 * no one lands on the crewmate the user last CHATTED with (`last_chat_ts`, a
 * server record, so it survives a gateway restart), else on the one last
 * opened in this browser if it is still on the roster, else on the most
 * recently USED chat (greatest `last_active_ts`). That is the conversation the user
 * most plausibly came back for, and it is a property of the user's own
 * history, not of the list order: #11763 rejected priming the user on
 * whichever row the SORT floated to the top, and that still holds — the
 * default follows use, never the sort. Only an EMPTY roster opens nothing;
 * it shows the New crewmate hero instead. Below md nothing auto-opens (the
 * phone's two-level list rule).
