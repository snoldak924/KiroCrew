/* "New conversation" on a crewmate's DM. The model forgets; nothing is deleted.
 *
 * The control lives in the crewmate's PROFILE card, not in the thread header
 * (reviewer's call): the one occasion anybody reaches for it is a crewmate stuck
 * in a turn, which is rare enough that a header button spends permanent space on
 * it. The row and its look are pinned in CrewProfilePanel.test.tsx; what this
 * file owns is the flow behind the press.
 *
 * Four things have to hold for that flow to be honest, and each one fails
 * quietly:
 *
 * `replay: false` must be SENT. The route defaults it to true, which replays the
 * discarded history straight back into the fresh context — so a call that omits
 * the flag answers 200 while changing nothing the user can see.
 *
 * The ask must come first, and it must say what survives — and that a running
 * turn is stopped. The context is gone for good once the call lands.
 *
 * A STUCK slot must work. The route refuses a busy slot with 409
 * `turn_in_flight`, and busy is the case this action exists for, so the flow
 * stops the turn and waits for it to let go before it asks for the reset. A
 * flow that only works on an idle slot works in exactly the situation nobody
 * needs it.
 *
 * A refusal must still be SHOWN. A turn that outlasts the stop budget, or an
 * inbound channel turn admitted after it, still earns a 409, and a swallowed one
 * reads as "nothing happened" over a conversation the model still remembers. */
