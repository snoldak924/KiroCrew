/**
 * The feature-intro video shown once at startup.
 *
 * Mounted only after `startupVideoGate` has ruled that this launch is free — that
 * module owns "may anything open at all", this file owns "what is it and what
 * does watching it mean". The split is what keeps the policy testable without the
 * dashboard and keeps this chunk lazy.
 *
 * The clip retires PERMANENTLY, by one of two verdicts, and both are one-way:
 * `seen` when the user watches most of it or presses the acknowledgement, and
 * `dismissed` when they close it. Neither is a snooze — the backend stops
 * offering a clip after either — so there is no "remind me" affordance here to
 * imply otherwise.
 *
 * The clip's BYTES are never fetched until the user asks for them: a `poster`
 * plus `preload="none"` means the browser draws the still and waits for a play.
 * That holds for a streamed clip too -- it is the whole cost argument for showing
 * this at startup, and a clip nobody plays must cost nothing but the poster. A
 * streamed clip says "Plays online" on the card instead, which is a disclosure
 * about a cost the user has NOT yet paid; buying a seek bar by spending CDN bytes
 * first would make that disclosure meaningless.
 *
 * A REMOTE clip pays one small request before the dialog opens:
 * `GET /api/feature-videos/probe`. A local one pays none, and that asymmetry is
 * the point. The backend's `offerable()` only offers a clip whose files it can see
 * on disk (`_asset_exists`), in the same request that hands the clip over -- so a
 * probe for a local clip re-runs a check the offer already passed and learns
 * nothing. A clip on a CDN is the case the offer CANNOT check, and the page cannot
 * check it either: a cross-origin HEAD is refused for want of CORS headers, so a
 * healthy clip reads as missing. Only the server can answer, and only for the
 * remote half. Without that answer a streamed clip opens a dialog around a still
 * that plays nothing, because under `preload="none"` the player's own `onError`
 * cannot fire until the user presses play.

          guards itself: it re-reads permission from a ref AFTER its export await,
          and that ref only refreshes while the card keeps rendering. Unmounting it
          on a revoked policy freezes the ref at `true`, and an export already in
          flight then opens the social composer anyway — the very navigation the
          revocation exists to stop. So the card stays and is handed the live
          answer, which it uses to show a notice and withdraw its own actions.
          Fail-closed still holds at the ENTRY: the Share button above is gated, so
