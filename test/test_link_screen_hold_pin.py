"""Pin the screen-then-resolve-by-name class, enumerated from source by condition.

THE CONDITION this gate enumerates:

    a function asks the filesystem whether path P is a link (the SCREEN), and
    then hands P -- or a name derived from P -- to something that resolves it,
    follows it, or reads through it (the USE).

The screen answers about a NAME at one instant. A USE that resolves that same
name afterwards can traverse a link planted in between, so the screen's verdict
does not carry. The cure is to hold one descriptor per component across both
halves, which makes the proof and the use the same walk.

Two things this gate deliberately does.

It finds sites by the CONDITION, never by a list of file names, because a key
shaped like "places that look like the ones already known" grows a defect one
site at a time. The list below is the declared BASELINE the condition's output is
compared against, not the search key.

And a USE is not only an ``os`` or ``pathlib`` call. A project helper that
resolves internally is equally a resolve at the call site, so the resolver set is
computed from source over the call graph. ``is_sensitive_path`` builds its
candidate forms with ``realpath``, so handing it a screened name is the probe.

Why the resolver set is bounded at ONE call hop. Depth 0 is the primitives alone
and misses a site whose USE is ``atomic_write`` rather than a primitive, so it
under-reports. Taken to a fixpoint the set saturates at about 20000 names --
essentially every function in the package, because nearly everything eventually
touches the filesystem -- and a saturated set makes the USE predicate vacuous and
the count meaningless. Depth 1 is the smallest hop count at which every control
module is found, so it is the honest one.

A run in which the controls do not all hit is UNKNOWN, not a pass: the condition
failed to find sites known to satisfy it, so its silence about everything else
carries no weight. :func:`test_control_modules_are_all_found` prints the count so
a reader sees the number rather than inferring it from a green tick.

The class divides into two kinds wanting OPPOSITE treatment, which is why this
gate pins a shape rather than converting callers. A site that VETS a link target
and then continues needs the hold. A site that refuses every link never traverses
one, so a hold buys it nothing -- and tightening it further costs an ordinary
Windows or macOS layout that puts a junction or symlink on the path to a config
directory, for no privilege gain. :data:`HELD_SITES` therefore names only the
sites whose contract is to hold, and those are the ones whose shape is asserted.

NOTHING here is skipped on Windows, which is the platform whose junctions are the
reason the hold exists. The shape gates read source, so they reach the same
verdict everywhere, including the mutation that proves the shape gate can tell a
held use from an unheld one. The two behavioural controls create their link with
:func:`platform_compat.symlink_or_junction` -- a symlink where the privilege
allows one, a directory junction otherwise -- so the layout under test is the
shape the product itself creates rather than a POSIX-only stand-in, and each one
drives BOTH platform branches: the one this host takes, and the chain-walking one
with the descriptor capability forced off, which is the only branch Windows has.
A control that silently skipped the branch it names would pass everywhere and
prove nothing where it matters.
