"""The freestyle agent-task spawn path backs off when the HOST declines.

The ``route == "execute"`` block in ``_do_poll`` spawns freestyle tasks
serially. Two things stop the ~400 attempts/min re-dispatch storm:

1. An ACCEPTED spawn (an id comes back — running, or queued behind the
   admission gate) marks its trigger task executed, so a queued spawn is not
   re-dispatched every poll while it waits for a slot.
2. A real host DECLINE — the admission memory floor refusing a wait it had no
   row to park, surfaced by ``build_spawn_impl`` as a ``SpawnError`` with
   ``declined=True`` — arms a cooldown during which no freestyle spawn is
   attempted, since a declined task is never marked done and would otherwise
   re-attempt on every one-second poll.

The backoff arms ONLY on a flagged decline. A ``SpawnError`` that is NOT a
decline (an empty task/agent, a store outage, a normalised impl fault) is a
per-task problem — it does NOT arm the cooldown and does NOT stop the other due
tasks that poll. An accepted spawn clears the cooldown, so a healthy host whose
spawns succeed is never throttled, and the hourly ``activity_budget`` meter
(recorded only after a successful spawn, see ``hooks.py``) is left untouched.
