Follows ``test_security_conductor_agent.py``'s installer half -- stub the agents
dir and ``build_agent_config``, run the installer, assert on the JSON it wrote --
and adds the three halves that agent does not have: a charter whose contract
sentences are pinned because the capability is the sentence, a crewmate record

another skill's scripts rather than carrying a copy.
