"""Overlapping session starts never activate a skill view older than the newest one.

Every start on a shared runtime re-prepares the native skill projection right
before ``session/set_mode`` and sends the alias that preparation published. Two
starts can overlap: one whose preparation read the agent's spec BEFORE an edit
revoked a grant, and one whose preparation read it after. The runtime has to keep
the newer view authoritative, so the older start may neither become the
runtime's projection nor send its alias once the newer view is adopted -- not on
its first attempt, not on a retry, and not by having the host answer its request
after the newer view was adopted.

These drive the REAL ``_activate_mode_bracketed``, reader and ``_send_and_await``
against a fake kiro-cli. Only ``prepare_native_skill_projection`` is scripted: it
"reads the spec" (a shared variable the test edits to model the revocation) and
can be parked between that read and its return, the gap in which the real
function waits on the cross-process alias lock.
