"""One predicate decides what withholds ``kirocrew-core``; two readers split its sources.

``session_mcp.native_mount_withholding`` answers whether a declaration the
session is subject to -- the agent spec's ``kirocrew-core`` entry, the global
``mcp.json`` the dashboard's tool toggle writes, or the per-project ``mcp.json``
-- carries a restriction the per-session element cannot express. The two readers
that ask it split the sources by what each one is. ``prepare_native_skill_projection``
judges the spec's entry at preparation and reads no settings file: a restriction
authored in the spec refuses the agent's view, naming the spec, and a clean spec
gets its view whatever the files say. ``session_mcp.kiro_control_plane_servers``
is the one reader of the settings files, at each session start: from a single
read it returns the elements it mounts and the verdicts it withholds on, and the
runtime refuses a session for a settings restriction -- a toggle written while
the runtime is warm, a restriction behind a broker stub, an unreadable file -- on
that verdict, without a read of its own, with a message naming the file, the
restriction and the way back. A direct-client projection
(``per_session_element=False``) mounts no element and skips the spec predicate;
only ``skill_search`` itself disabled or excluded still refuses. These tests pin
the split, that both readers reach the same answer for the same declaration, and
that every retained refusal is bounded and cleaned before it is kept.
