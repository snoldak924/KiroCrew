"""Tests for ``api_upload_file`` (POST /api/upload/file).

The endpoint itself was shipped earlier; what's new in is the
post-write diagnostic block that compares the bytes received in memory
against the bytes that landed on disk and logs sha256 + magic + zipfile
status. The block is wrapped in try/except so a diagnostic-internal
failure can never break an upload, and is only emitted for binary
extensions (DOC + IMAGE), not text. These tests pin both the success path
(match=True, is_zipfile=True for a real zip) and the rejection path
(unsupported extensions short-circuit before the diagnostic runs).
