"""The fork refresh fails closed on every branch that cannot vouch for a fork.

A fork carries ``allowedTools`` and ``autoApprove`` grants that never reach the
PreToolUse gate, so a fork whose last refresh did not re-filter them must not start a
session. ``_fork_refresh_failed`` is how the refresh says so: ``"*"`` when the pass
died before per-fork accounting, the fork's name when that one fork could not be
refreshed. These pin each branch, and that the spawn gate's settled event is set
again whenever no pass is left to set it.
