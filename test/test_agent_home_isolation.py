"""Agent-spec home isolation — the KIRO_HOME seam, the worktree guard, and the
anti-regression guard that keeps ``~/.kiro/agents`` from being hard-coded again.

Regression context: a gateway booted from a linked git worktree rewrote the
machine-wide ``~/.kiro/agents/*.json`` on startup, stamping its own ``.venv``
binary into every managed server's ``command`` and its own data home into their
``env``. The real install's MCP servers then ran the worktree's code and read the
worktree's credential while still calling the live gateway, so every managed MCP
call returned HTTP 403 — and once the worktree was removed those specs pointed at
paths that were gone.

# Both spellings must be caught. The tuple form ``"​.kiro" / "agents"`` was the

# HOME-RELATIVE literals
# (the matcher anchors ``$HOME``-relative strings; ``kiro_agents_dir()`` returns
# an absolute path, so the resolver's value cannot be used here) and which is
# kept literal on purpose to avoid a config->security import cycle — the same
# convention as the ``.data-home-ready`` marker literal. It does NOT read or
# write the dir (it only matches path strings) and it re-anchors ``KIRO_HOME``
# for that entry, so it cannot reintroduce the reader/writer split-brain this
# guard exists to catch; ``TestKiroAgentsDirWriteProtection`` pins the literal to
# ``kiro_agents_dir()`` so drift still fails loudly.
# string it refuses to ship in a curated bundle. It only matches path components
# and never reads or writes the agents dir, and the packager runs in a standalone
# deployment venv where ``config.paths`` is not importable, so it cannot route
# through ``kiro_agents_dir()`` even in principle.
