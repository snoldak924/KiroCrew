"""Tests for the chat (sidebar) folder tools on the kirocrew-dashboard server.

Covers ``chat_folder_tree/create/move/move_session/delete/file_self`` — schema
validation, path→id resolution, mkdir -p, session-reference resolution, the
requests sent, and result formatting. Each case runs one tools/call frame
through ``mcp_dashboard.TABLE`` against an in-memory dashboard and asserts on
the reply and on what the dashboard was asked; the endpoints themselves are
tested by ``test_folder_store_writer.py`` and ``test_dashboard_chat.py``.
