"""Tests for the HOSTED half of feature videos: signed manifest, cache, serving.

Signatures here are real. Keys and signing go through
``test/feature_video_fixture.py``, which mints a throwaway RSA pair per test and
repoints ``feed_trust``'s pins at it, so the positive path is exercised with genuine
openssl verification rather than a stubbed "it verified" — a stub would pass for a
manifest nobody signed, which is the one failure this module exists to prevent.

:class:`TestSharedFixture` additionally verifies the COMMITTED fixture at
``test/fixtures/feature-videos/manifest.json``. That artifact is the cross-tool
contract: the publishing tool's tests verify the same bytes, so the signed byte
format is pinned in one place instead of in two helpers that can drift.

Network is faked throughout: ``asset_downloader.build_opener`` is replaced per
test — the one seam the manifest fetch and the media transfer share.
``feature_videos`` itself makes no request at all.
