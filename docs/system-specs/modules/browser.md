## Browser Module

Website browsing has two agent paths. In the desktop app, the `browser` MCP
tool drives the Browser panel's native embedded Chromium view. When no native
panel serves the session, or `dashboard.use_builtin_browser` is off, the tool
directs the agent to the `playwright-cli` shell path. Kiro Crew owns the CLI
install flow, snapshot directory, command bus, and dashboard surfaces.

### Architecture

The native path is a **single MCP tool, not a Playwright tool namespace.** Its
`op` enum exposes `navigate`, `snapshot`, `click`, `type`, `press_key`, `hover`,
`select_option`, `screenshot`, `wait_for`, `back`, and `console`. The MCP shim
posts one bounded command to the gateway's in-memory bus; Electron long-polls the
bus, runs the operation in the panel it owns, and posts the result. A missing
panel fails fast to the CLI fallback. The agent still decides per task whether a
browser is warranted or whether `web_fetch` answers the question.

```
agent turn ──MCP browser(op, args)──▶ gateway command bus ──▶ Electron native view
     │                                      │
     │                                      └─ no panel / built-in disabled
     └─shell fallback──▶ playwright-cli <verb> …
                              │
                              ├─▶ stdout: page URL, title, snapshot YAML path
                              └─▶ disk:   .../page-<timestamp>.yml
```

The native route is session-bound. The MCP shim sends the namespaced session key
in the authenticated request header and the bare slot key in the body, matching
the panel registration. The gateway bounds queues to 32 commands per session,
uses 15-second operation timeouts (60 seconds for `navigate` and `wait_for`), and
expires panel liveness after 30 seconds without a drain or result. The three
internal routes are `/api/browser/command`, `/api/browser/command-drain`, and
`/api/browser/command-result`; all require internal-secret authentication and do
not accept dashboard-cookie callers.

The gateway also runs exactly two kinds of CLI command, neither on an agent's
behalf: the `show` dashboard it supervises ([Dashboard
integration](#dashboard-integration)), and the browsing verb behind the Browser
panel's address bar ([Address bar launcher](#address-bar-launcher)), which a
HUMAN triggers by pressing Enter in an authenticated dashboard. Agent CLI
fallback actions still go through the ordinary shell approval path.

**The CLI stdout line is the contract.** Every CLI command prints the resulting page URL,
the page title, and a filesystem path to a snapshot YAML. Roughly 250 characters
of stdout carry a complete action result, and the accessibility tree stays on
disk until the agent decides it needs it. This is why no compression layer
exists: a wrapper that read the YAML and summarized it would put the tree back
into the model context, which is the cost the on-disk handoff removes.

**The path printed on stdout is authoritative.** The agent uses the exact path it
was given rather than deriving one, because the snapshot directory is owned by the
gateway (see [Snapshot retention](#snapshot-retention)) and is not the agent's
working directory.

**Element refs are per-snapshot.** A ref such as `[ref=e5]` identifies an element
within the snapshot that produced it, and any page change invalidates it. The
invariant an agent must hold is therefore: after a navigation, a click that
changes the page, or a reload, take a fresh `snapshot` and address elements from
that one. A ref reused across a page change either misses or hits the wrong
element, and the failure is silent in the second case, which is why the rule is
stated as re-snapshot rather than as retry-on-error.

**Sessions are named.** `-s=<name>` selects a session, so several independent
browsing contexts coexist under one CLI install and one agent can keep a
logged-in context separate from a throwaway one.

### Skill contract

The shipped browser and computer-use skills are self-contained: custom agents can
replace the base prompt. Compression removes repeated explanations within a skill,
not operational constraints or tool signatures. Each workflow retains its applicable
session-family isolation, printed-path and fresh-ref rules, approval and refusal
boundaries, borrowed-browser and pointer/password safety, and privacy inspection
plus explicit authorization before publishing. No shared prompt fragment is needed
to execute a loaded skill safely.

### Capability model

**Presence of a vetted `playwright-cli` launcher is availability, not approval.**
The product-managed copy lives at `<data-home>/playwright-cli` and is
read-only inside every agent sandbox. Gateway execution resolves that leaf first,
then fixed system install directories whose launcher, Node executable and package
entry hierarchies the gateway user cannot write. The managed installer stages the
native Node executable inside the same leaf, and every gateway-owned invocation
runs that copy plus the attributed `playwright-cli.js` directly; neither a POSIX
`env node` shebang nor a Windows batch launcher chooses the runtime. Resolution
never uses `PATH`, `~/.local/bin`, the active project, or the workspace. No safe
direct pair means the gateway capability does not exist; installing one makes the
command available but does not let a shell turn skip the ordinary approval
ladder. A dashboard session must receive an interactive command grant, a
trusted-command pattern, or an explicit trust/auto-approve mode before the
command runs without a prompt.

The CLI exposes no capability toggle of its own: once an approved shell turn
runs the binary, all of its verbs are reachable. `dashboard.use_builtin_browser`
(default `true`) selects the native MCP path in the desktop app; turning it off
routes allowed browsing to the CLI and does not override the governance
`capabilities.browse` denial. That limitation does not turn binary presence into
consent for automatic CLI execution.

#### Approval boundary

A working product-managed copy or vetted system install grants no silent
execution authority. The managed bin directory leads the agent subprocess PATH so
an approved shell command can keep spelling `playwright-cli`, but the sandbox
withholds writes to the whole prefix. Gateway code never consumes that PATH. A
shim planted in `~/.local/bin`, the project, the workspace, or another writable
PATH directory is diagnosed once at WARNING and ignored.

The first CLI command prompts under normal mode. The operator can approve once,
trust the command pattern for the session, or deliberately enable wider
auto-approval. The last two choices are ordinary audited trust decisions and
remain subject to the deny and governance gates. The native `browser` tool has a
separate bounded surface: governance is checked before dispatch, and `navigate`
auto-drives only public HTTP(S) targets. Literal loopback, private, link-local,
reserved, alternate- or percent-encoded IP or host name, non-ASCII host,
parser-differential, and non-HTTP
forms are refused and directed to the approval-gated CLI path; DNS names are not
resolved, so public-name-to-private-address rebinding remains an accepted
residual.

### Install flow

Global install only. `npx` re-resolves the package through the npm registry on
every invocation, which makes browsing depend on registry auth at run time: an
expired token takes the capability down mid-session. A global binary resolves
once, at install, so registry auth applies at install time only.

1. Detect a vetted managed or fixed-system `playwright-cli`, plus Node.js 20 or
   newer. Resolution never consults `PATH`.
2. Install when absent: `npm install -g --prefix <data-home>/playwright-cli
   @playwright/cli@latest`. The installed version comes from the attributed
   package's `node_modules/@playwright/cli/package.json`, read directly on the
   two rare detection and Browser-view spawn paths. The prefix holds the
   entrypoint and package tree.
   The sandbox pre-creates this directory and exposes it read-only to agent
   descendants; the gateway installer runs outside that sandbox. Before npm
   receives the prefix, the installer creates the leaf and pins it with the
   cross-platform no-follow directory opener; a symlink, Windows reparse point,
   or create/open identity race aborts before package files are written, and the
   Windows handle prevents rename while npm runs. On every OS the installer
   resolves the native executable behind any version-manager shim and atomically
   stages it inside the same leaf (`gateway-node` on POSIX, `node.exe` on
   Windows). Gateway-owned calls invoke that sealed Node with
   `@playwright/cli`'s JavaScript entrypoint directly. Generated POSIX wrappers
   and Windows `.cmd` launchers remain shell-facing identities only, so neither
   PATH-based interpreter selection nor command-processor reparsing reaches a
   gateway request.
   The bootstrap itself is the one step that still reads the gateway's
   environment: `npm` and the source `node` are resolved ONCE per install
   through `env.find_node_tool` (version-manager dirs, then the gateway `PATH`),
   and those same paths are what run. No trust policy refuses them — nvm, fnm,
   volta and mise all install into user-writable directories under `$HOME`, so
   rejecting writable toolchains would break most real installs. Instead the
   installer logs each resolved path, its symlink-resolved target, and the first
   component of its hierarchy the gateway user can write
   (`install.bootstrap_tool_provenance`, built on the same
   `_gateway_writable_component` walk the CLI resolver refuses on, so the two
   cannot disagree). `kirocrew doctor` prints the same answer as `browser npm:` /
   `browser node:` rows: ✅ when nothing is writable; ℹ️ when the writable
   component is owned by the gateway's own account with no group/other write bit
   — nvm, fnm, volta and mise under `$HOME`, and Homebrew's 0755 user-owned
   `/opt/homebrew` prefix (its `g+rwx` subdirectories sit below the prefix, which
   the walk reaches first), which only an account that already runs the gateway
   can replace; ⚠️ when it is group- or world-writable (another account could
   swap the binary, as with a legacy root-owned `/usr/local` over a `g+rwx`
   `bin`) or owned by a different account. The warning is never recorded as a doctor issue.
   Doctor repeats the lookup with its OWN shell's `PATH`, which can differ from a
   service-managed gateway's, and its rows say so; the install-time log line is
   the authoritative record of what ran. Writability is reported as unchecked on
   Windows, where `os.access` ignores ACLs.
3. `playwright-cli install-browser chromium` for the baseline browser binary.
   The engine argument is required: omitting it installs every engine and lets an
   optional Firefox or WebKit dependency failure veto a working Chromium setup.
   The CLI downloads Chromium on first use regardless, so the explicit step exists
   to give the operator a progress surface and a visible failure rather than a
   stall inside the first browse. `--with-deps` is appended only on an apt host,
   and a refusal there is retried without it; OS libraries on every other host
   are a separate operator action — see [OS dependencies](#os-dependencies).
4. `playwright-cli install --skills agents --global` so the command reference is
   discoverable from the skill file rather than occupying the system prompt.
   `--skills` accepts `claude` (default) or `agents`; `--global` targets the home
   directory instead of the workspace.
5. Record that the install happened.

The next install writes the vetted managed copy. A launcher left by an older
release at `~/.local/bin/playwright-cli` is left untouched and ignored; no cleanup
or fallback executes it.

### Install jobs

The gateway owns one install slot. The CLI setup above and a single-engine
download (`POST /api/browser/engine`) both run in it as a **job**, and the job,
not the page that clicked, is what the settings panel renders. A refreshed page or
a second tab therefore sees the same operation, engine, stage and elapsed time.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `cli_setup` or `engine_download` |
| `engine` | the engine an `engine_download` fetches; `null` for `cli_setup` |
| `status` | `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `interrupted` |
| `stage` | `preparing`, `installing_cli`, `downloading_browser`, `installing_skills`, `finishing` |
| `error_code` | `step_failed`, `timeout`, `exception`, `interrupted`, or `null` |
| `error_detail` | the decisive step's output, redacted in full and then cut to 2000 characters |

- The job is published (`running`, `preparing`) before its worker starts, so no
  poll can observe the slot busy with nothing to show.
- Stages come from a callback the installer calls between steps, never from
  parsing its stdout. The worker thread marshals each one onto the event loop,
  and an update carrying another job's id is dropped, so a late callback cannot
  overwrite a newer job.
- The last step decides the outcome, as before: a recovered attempt stays in the
  step list without failing the job.
- The latest terminal job is kept until the next one replaces it, so a poll that
  arrives after completion still sees the result.
- `POST /api/browser/install` joins a running `cli_setup` job. Any other running
  job answers **409** `install_already_running` with that job's snapshot, from
  either endpoint; the owner check and the 400s for a malformed body run first.
- `installing` and `last_error` are kept for older clients and are derived from
  the job.
- Job state is in memory. A restarted gateway reports `install_job: null`, never
  a stale running job, and nothing resumes on its own.
- Installer children run in their own process group. A timeout kills the whole
  tree rather than only the direct child. Both the dashboard and API-only
  lifecycles register `_register_browser_install_cleanup` before runner setup;
  cancelling the job task at shutdown kills the tree and marks the job
  `interrupted`.
- **Accepted residual:** a restart path that ends the process with `os._exit`
  skips that cancellation, so an installer running at that moment finishes on its
  own. Playwright's registry directory lock serializes a duplicate browser
  download; a concurrent `npm install -g` into the managed prefix is not guarded.

### Readiness

`browser_ok` answers "is a build at the revision the installed CLI requires on
disk". A cache directory carries its revision (`chromium-1232`), and
playwright-core launches only the exact revision bound to its own version, so the
match is **exact** on the revision the CLI requires. A prefix match ignores the
revision, and a stale
`chromium-1208` left from before a CLI upgrade then reads as present while the
launch fails `Browser "chromium" is not installed` — and because the gate reads
ready, the panel never offers the download that would fix it. The prefix form also
let `chromium_headless_shell-<rev>` satisfy `chromium`, which is a different
artifact.

The required revision comes from `playwright-core/browsers.json`, the file
`install-browser` itself consults. Reading it is a plain file read, so readiness
stays subprocess-free.

**The manifest is attributed to a `@playwright/cli` package, never searched for.**
Resolution anchors on that package — the hoisted sibling in the same
`node_modules`, a copy nested under the package, or the standalone installer's
known prefix (`KIROCREW_PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_HOME`, else `<data home>/playwright-cli`).
Anchoring is a correctness property, not an optimization: walking ancestors
instead passes through `$HOME` on the standalone layout, where one unrelated
`~/node_modules/playwright-core` supplies a revision from a **different** install.
That reports a working browser broken and keeps doing so after the offered
download, because the gate goes on reading the foreign file. The standalone prefix
is probed by path because that installer generates a **wrapper script** rather
than a symlink, so its package tree is not an ancestor of the launcher at all.

When no manifest can be attributed, the revision is unknown and readiness falls
back to the older presence-only answer: any complete `<engine>-*` build counts,
and so does a complete `<engine>_<host>_special-*` build, since without a required
revision there is nothing to hold either directory against.
Absent metadata is an unknown, not evidence of a stale cache, so it must not turn
a working browser into a reported broken one.

**A directory is not a download.** The installer creates the revision directory
before it finishes, so a build counts only when that directory holds Playwright's
`INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` marker. Checking the marker is a file read; readiness
never launches the build.

Per-engine readiness is reported as `browser_status`:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `downloaded` | the required-revision directory (or its platform `_special` override) holds the completion marker |
| `missing` | the cache was read and holds no complete build, including one an interrupted download left behind |
| `unknown` | the cache or marker could not be read, the platform has no known cache location, or the expected directory is absent or incomplete while a complete build the ported host-platform key did not predict exists: a `<engine>_*_special-*` build when the plain one was expected, or the plain required-revision build when a `_special` one was (only playwright-core's own platform logic picks the directory, so the ported key may be stale against the installed CLI) |

`browsers[engine]` is true only for `downloaded`, and `browser_ok` is
`browser_status.chromium == "downloaded"`. "Downloaded" is filesystem evidence;
whether the build launches is a separate fact the panel does not claim.

The cache location follows playwright-core's registry, so detection looks where
the installer writes:

| Setting | Cache |
|---|---|
| `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` (also `npm_config_…` / `npm_package_config_…`) | that path; a relative value resolves against `INIT_CWD`, else the gateway's working directory |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` | `.local-browsers` inside the CLI's own `playwright-core` package |
| Linux | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/ms-playwright`, else `~/.cache/ms-playwright` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright`, else `~\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` |

### Command surface

The full reference lives in the skill the CLI installs in step 4, which is why the
system prompt states only the loop and the ref rule. The CLI is installed at `@latest`
(`install.py` `NPM_SPEC`), so its verbs can drift; the table below is a summary, and the
installed skill is authoritative. The verbs:

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle | `open [url]`, `goto`, `close`, `attach --extension` |
| Pointer and form | `click <ref>`, `dblclick`, `fill <ref> <text>`, `type <text>`, `select`, `check`, `uncheck`, `hover`, `drag`, `upload` |
| Read | `snapshot`, `screenshot [ref]`, `pdf`, `eval`, `console`, `requests`, `request <i>`, `request-headers`/`request-body`, `response-headers`/`response-body`, `network-state-set` |
| Navigation | `go-back`, `go-forward`, `reload`, `press <key>`, `resize` |
| Dialogs | `dialog-accept`, `dialog-dismiss` |
| Tabs | `tab-list`, `tab-new`, `tab-select`, `tab-close` |
| State | `state-save [file]`, `state-load <file>`, `cookie-list`/`get`/`set`/`delete`/`clear`, `localstorage-*`, `sessionstorage-*` |
| Capture and scripting | `route`, `run-code`, `tracing-start`/`stop`, `video-start`/`stop` |
| Host | `show`, `install --skills`, `install-browser`, `config-print` |

Sessions are selected with `-s=<name>` on any command.

### Generated session reachability

Each agent process receives a generated `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION`
(`kc-<random>`). For generated sessions only, `PWTEST_SOCKETS_DIR` and
`PWTEST_DAEMON_SESSION_DIR` point at separate short namespaces under
`<data-home>/pw/<8hex>/s` and `/d`. A `playwright-cli list` in one agent
therefore cannot enumerate peer chat families. Operator-configured PWTEST roots
are treated as base directories and receive the same generated-session
namespace. Relative configured roots are rejected because the gateway and agent
working directories can differ. Operator-provided non-`kc-` session names
preserve their complete existing Playwright environment and are not redirected.

Keeping both locations outside scratch means a daemon remains reachable after
its agent process or scratch directory is gone. Operator cleanup supplies the
generated session's `/s` and `/d` paths with the corresponding PWTEST variables
and then uses the ordinary `playwright-cli -s=<name> close` protocol.
Reclamation never executes the CLI or connects to a daemon's socket: a stray has
no registry entry to resolve and its socket is unlinked by the first refused
connect, so a registry-driven `close` reclaims nothing. (The gateway does run the
CLI for its own two purposes — the `show` dashboard and the address bar launcher
— but never against a generated `kc-` session, and never to reclaim one.)

### Stranded daemon reclamation

Reachability alone does not reclaim a daemon whose agent died, so the orphan
sweep (`session_pid`) carries a browser-daemon class alongside its MCP,
gatewayd and work classes. playwright-core spawns the daemon as `node
<...>/entry/cliDaemon.js <session-name>` with `detached: true` and no `env`
override, which decides both halves of the identity. Detachment makes it its
own session and process-group leader, so it is invisible to the teardown child
snapshot, to `kill_process_tree`, and to the SID ownership test the work class
uses. Inheriting the environment verbatim puts the generated
`PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` and `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` in its exec-time environ, which
the kernel holds immutable after exec.

A daemon is reclaimed only when all of these hold: a structural cliDaemon argv
whose following element is a generated `kc-<8hex>` name; that same name in its
exec-time environ; the `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` marker; no live process outside the
daemon's own SID still holding that session; and an age past the work-class
floor. The owner scan remains fail-closed for unreadable process data. One
kernel relationship makes the common systemd case decidable: a process whose
stable unified cgroup v2 membership differs from the daemon's cannot belong to
the spawn tree that inherited its generated browser session, so an unreadable
environ there is ignored. This excludes system stubs such as `(sd-pam)` and
`sshd-session` without a growing name list. Recognizable agent, gateway, shell,
and browser-tooling process names remain plausible owners in every cgroup. Only
a positively named non-owner with proven different cgroup membership is
ignored. A same-cgroup process, unreadable process name, unreadable cgroup, or
cgroup that changes during the probe also keeps the daemon. A DEBUG verdict records `decision=keep|sweep` and a closed `reason`,
with a separate owner-probe line when an unreadable different-cgroup process is
ignored or an inconclusive owner keeps the daemon. Ownership is therefore
proven from kernel facts alone -- argv, exec-time environ, session id, cgroup,
and process liveness -- never from filesystem state a same-UID agent could
write, which is what made earlier reaper attempts unsafe. The probe scans the
whole process table rather than a manager-local set, so a peer gateway sharing
this data home sees and protects its own live sessions. An operator-named
session is structurally excluded and never signalled; the `kc-` prefix is
reserved so the two populations cannot be confused. The Browser
panel's own sessions (`panel-<owner6>-<slot8>`, see [Address bar
launcher](#address-bar-launcher)) are deliberately in the operator-class
population: a generated name would have the sweep kill the human's browser the
moment its short-lived CLI invocation exited, so their lifetime is owned by the
gateway instead — and **the owner is legible from the name**. Several gateways
on one host can share the CLI's session registry (it is keyed by working
directory; a pod started from the live checkout, or a second install, sees the
same entries), so the first six hex digits are a digest of the owning gateway's
data home: a sibling never produces this gateway's tag, a `goto` against a
session already open under our name can only be reaching this gateway's own
previous life, and only sessions under our prefix are ever closed. Two hooks
enforce that: shutdown closes every session this life opened (`close_all`), and
startup closes every session under this gateway's prefix that the CLI still
lists as up and this life has not recorded (`reclaim_stranded`, a background
task so a CLI spawn never gates the port bind) — the previous life that died
without reaching its shutdown hook. A panel session therefore never outlives the
gateway that owns it; an unclean death only defers the close to the next start.
**Accepted cost:** there is no idle timeout, cap or LRU on `panel-` sessions —
one Chromium daemon per chat slot whose address bar was used, alive for the
gateway's life. The bound is a dashboard's handful of slots, a human's open
browser is exactly what must not be closed under them (their logins live in it),
and the human closes one themselves from the framed grid when they are done;
a close policy is a follow-up if that bound is ever exceeded in practice.
What startup reclamation reads is the registry, same-user-writable filesystem
state the sweep above refuses to act on — acceptable here because the only
action it can be tricked into is a `close` of a session under our own prefix, a
capability a same-user process already has directly (see the Security table).
Every stage fails
closed: non-Linux, an unreadable `/proc`, and an inconclusive per-process read
all read as "owner alive". The kill signals the process GROUP so the Chromium
tree goes with the supervisor, TERM first for a clean profile flush, only for a
genuine isolated group leader, with identity re-verified before escalating to
SIGKILL and the result SEL-audited.

Deliberately not keyed on the socket path the way the gatewayd class is:
`Session._connect` unlinks the socket whenever a connect fails, so an absent
socket records a refused connect rather than an unreachable daemon, and the
daemon holds its listening descriptor either way.

The generated socket root is rejected when its worst-case AF_UNIX path exceeds
the upstream 103-byte budget. Before either variable is injected, the installed
`@playwright/cli` package resolved from the active launcher is checked through
the same package anchor as browser revision detection (a stale standalone
fallback is never accepted), and its serving `playwright-core` sources must
contain both hooks on their execution paths (`process.env.PWTEST_SOCKETS_DIR ||`
and `process.env.PWTEST_DAEMON_SESSION_DIR`). A future upstream
rename/removal therefore logs a warning and fails back instead of silently
returning sockets to scratch. The source verdict is cached by path, mtime, and
size so an upgrade invalidates it.

Kiro-Crew-owned lifecycle directories are created
owner-only and then restricted with the fail-loud platform helper before their
environment variables are exported. A crash can leave a small per-session
registry/socket namespace behind. Reclaiming the daemon does not delete that
namespace: it is two empty directories, and pruning them would need its own
liveness argument for no memory benefit.

### Auth

Two paths, chosen by whose browser holds the session.

**Saved state.** `state-save [file]` writes the current context's cookies and
storage to a file, and `state-load <file>` restores it into a session. A logged-in
context is therefore reusable across sessions and across gateway restarts without
re-authenticating. `cookie-list`/`get`/`set`/`delete`/`clear` and the
`localstorage-*` / `sessionstorage-*` families operate on individual entries when
a whole-state round trip is heavier than the task needs.

**Attach.** `attach --extension` connects to the operator's own running Chrome,
which already holds their logins, so no state file is involved. This is the
stronger capability of the two: the sessions are the operator's real ones, which
is why the [approval boundary](#approval-boundary) above is mandatory.

State files hold live session credentials and are written with owner-only
permissions.

**The attach token.** `attach --extension` works without one: the extension
answers a tokenless handshake by asking the human to approve the connection in the
browser. Setting `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN` removes that one click and
nothing else, so it is opt-in and absent by default. `browser_cli/token.py` stores
it owner-only behind `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` — the agent inherits it through
the environment and can never open the file — and no status surface returns the
value, only whether one exists.

The extension presents the token as a shell assignment, so the settings field
accepts either form and stores the same token:

```
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN=<value>
<value>
```

`normalize_paste` strips the prefix only when the text left of the **first** `=`
is exactly the variable name. That condition is a safety property rather than a
nicety: these tokens are base64url and can legitimately contain `=`, so a looser
rule would corrupt a bare token. `export`/`set` keywords and a matched pair of
surrounding quotes are removed for the same reason. Normalization also runs on
read, so a stored value holding the whole assignment repairs itself instead of
reporting "stored" while the extension keeps prompting. Clearing ignores an
already-absent file, but any other unlink failure propagates through the API so
the settings panel cannot report success while the credential remains active.

### Launch config

Kiro Crew installs, gates on, and offers downloads for **Chromium**:
`install-browser` fetches the Chromium build, `browser_ok` is
`browsers_present()["chromium"]`, and `attach --extension` supports that family
alone. The CLI's own default is a different browser — the branded Chrome
*channel*, an OS-level install at a path like `/opt/google/chrome/chrome` that
Kiro Crew never provisions and cannot install without root. So on a host that did
everything the product asked, the first browse fails with

```
Chromium distribution 'chrome' is not found at /opt/google/chrome/chrome
```

while every readiness signal is honestly green, because the Chromium build really
is downloaded. `browser_cli/launch.py` closes that gap by naming the engine.

**Why a config file rather than a flag or a browser env var.** All three exist and
only the file works for a whole session:

| Mechanism | Why it cannot carry this |
|---|---|
| `--browser` | takes `chrome, firefox, webkit, msedge` — `chromium` is not accepted |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BROWSER` | the same four values, so it cannot name the installed engine either |
| `--config` | accepted only on the session-establishing commands (`open`, `attach`) and rejected by the follow-up commands that make up most of a session |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` | names a config **file** and applies to every invocation uniformly |

The last one is the mechanism used, and for the same reason as
[snapshot retention](#snapshot-retention): the agent runs the CLI as a shell
command, so an inherited environment variable is the only channel that reaches an
invocation Kiro Crew never constructs. The config is written under the data home
at a fixed absolute path, independent of whichever working directory a turn ran in.

The schema is **nested** under a `browser` key — `{"browser": {"browserName":
"chromium"}}`. A flat top-level `browserName` parses without error and selects
nothing, which presents as the branded-Chrome failure above rather than as a
config error.

**The generated config names the engine and nothing else.** Every added key
becomes a default an operator must discover in order to override, and the engine
is the only one the install flow already decided.

**The browser sandbox is deliberately untouched.** Chromium's sandbox is a
security boundary, so no generated default removes it. A host that cannot run it —
a container lacking the kernel permissions, where the failure is
`No usable sandbox!` — needs an operator decision rather than a default that
quietly drops the boundary for every host. That is what the escape hatch is for:
when `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` is **already set** in the environment, Kiro Crew adds
nothing and the operator's file wins entirely. Naming a config is how an operator
selects a different engine, pins an `executablePath`, or accepts the sandbox
trade-off on a host that requires it.

### Snapshot retention

The CLI writes one timestamped YAML per command and documents no pruning, so the
directory grows without bound.

**The gateway service prunes it on a schedule.** Retention belongs to a
long-lived component rather than to the agent for two reasons: the agent has no
reason to know the policy, and a per-command prune would race the daemon.
Snapshots are throwaway state, so retention is by age and count. The service
never deletes a file the current session still refers to, because the path on
stdout is the agent's only handle to the tree.

This is also why the snapshot directory is at a fixed path the service owns
rather than relative to whatever working directory an agent happened to have.

### Dashboard integration

`playwright-cli show --port <n> --host 127.0.0.1` serves the CLI's own dashboard
over loopback HTTP, and the panel embeds that in an iframe. A remote or tunneled
dashboard reaches the view through the same-origin relay (`/browser-view/<token>/`,
below), so it needs no extra port. The port is OS-assigned by default;
`dashboard.browser_view_port` pins it, which matters only for the direct-`url`
fallback the panel uses when the relay path is not offered. The pin is never handed
to the child: the supervisor claims the pinned port itself with a bound listener it
keeps holding, an atomic ownership proof that makes the deterministic,
operator-named port race-free, and relays byte-for-byte to the child's own
ephemeral port. With a usable attribution path, the child keeps the unpinned
path's advisory bind window (unpredictable, loopback-local). On a structurally
blind host it instead receives port 0 and lets the kernel choose while binding;
both paths bind loopback only. After the child answers, the supervisor asks
`platform_compat.probe_port_listeners` who owns its port. A PID in the spawned
process tree is positive ownership proof. When that global lookup is absent or
cannot attribute a known listener, the supervisor checks the spawned child and
its current descendants by PID. Linux follows direct child lists under
`/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children`; macOS uses `proc_listchildpids`. The walk
starts at the spawned root and reads only PIDs it discovers in that subtree.
The supervisor captures the root start ID immediately after `Popen` returns and
stores it with the exact live process handle. Startup, adoption, and reuse all
require that same handle to remain alive and its current start ID to equal the
captured value before and after listener confirmation; a mismatch is reaped and
replaced rather than treated as this Browser view.
For every candidate PID, parentage and start identity come from one kernel read:
Linux uses one `/proc/<pid>/stat` value, while macOS uses one
`PROC_PIDTBSDINFO` value with microsecond start resolution. The shared process-start
comparator classifies each edge as later, earlier, or inconclusive. A
strictly later child may join the tree; a strictly earlier child is the stale
orphan shape and its subtree is excluded. Equal coarse timestamps or unparseable
identities make the ownership result inconclusive rather than foreign. The
parent must keep its identity across the child-list read, and each descendant
must keep its identity around the listener probe. Every PID reported by the
global listener lookup must also keep a readable start identity across the
descendant walk. A missing or changed owner makes the verdict inconclusive;
`FOREIGN` requires every reported owner to stay identity-stable while none
belongs to the supervised tree.

If the atomic path is unavailable, the POSIX fallback takes two
`ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,lstart=` snapshots. It derives the root subtree from the
first snapshot and requires every row in that subtree to remain identical in
the second; a missing, reparented, or re-identified row makes the whole result
inconclusive, while unrelated process churn is ignored. Every returned identity
tags its source as either atomic or `lstart`; listener verification re-reads
through that exact source. An unavailable source is inconclusive and never
falls across to a differently encoded identity. Parent and child created in
the same displayed second therefore yield an inconclusive proof. Windows
brackets two Toolhelp PID-to-PPID snapshots with the query-only process
creation-time primitive. Each listener candidate's path to the root must keep
the same PIDs, creation IDs, and edges; the three-way order rule applies to
every edge, while unrelated helper siblings may appear or disappear. Each
positive owner-PID-table observation is bracketed by process-identity checks
before it becomes ownership proof. A changed or unreadable identity on the
candidate chain is inconclusive; bare-PID ancestry never authorizes a URL.
Windows Browser ownership reads the in-process owner-PID listener tables and
never invokes `netstat`. A positive root or identity-stable descendant result
proves the child. A failed target-table read remains inconclusive after the
control self-test, even when that control succeeds. A completed target negative
can become foreign only after the control listener proves the table functional
and every identity-stable root and descendant check completes negative.
Other POSIX hosts run `lsof` scoped with `-p <pid>`. Exit 1 means a completed
no-match only when stdout and stderr are both empty; any diagnostic makes
ownership inconclusive. The control-listener self-test runs before a spawn when
`ensure_running` must choose between the ordinary fixed-child-port path and the
structurally blind `--port 0` path. During reuse it runs only after an
inconclusive target lookup. Its result is cached for the gateway process by the
resolved `lsof` path or the Windows API identity. A tool-path change or
replacement Browser child invalidates the cache. If the self-test proved `lsof`
globally blind, its PID-scoped empty result is inconclusive too. Windows reads
IPv4 and IPv6 owner-PID listener tables in-process with
`GetExtendedTcpTable`. The control self-test proves capability only when the
owner-PID table attributes the listener it just bound to the gateway's own PID;
a completed table without that PID is blind, and a failed table read is
inconclusive. A completed target-table read makes per-process ownership checks
definitive without `netstat`. A completed identity-attributed check for every
PID that finds no owner is a definitive mismatch even if another process answers
the health probe.

Only a structurally blind host falls back to trusted child stdout during
startup. A transient incomplete probe on a structurally capable host remains
inconclusive even if a fresh startup line is available. The parser extracts the
scheme, host, and port from a listener line, so harmless banner prefixes,
separators, and URL paths may change without disabling the panel. It still
requires HTTP, `127.0.0.1`, and either the assigned port or, for a port-0
request, a valid child-selected port. The child proof retains both values: the
requested port passed to `show` and the banner-reported bound port. A requested
zero matches the resolved port only when it equals that recorded banner value.
Playwright writes the line only after its server binds, and a process racing for
a supervisor-selected TCP port cannot
write to the child's pipe. A reader that consumes stdout without finding a
recognized listener URL fails closed and logs the installed `playwright-cli`
version beside the verified banner form. On a structurally blind host,
`status()` names the same runtime contract in operator terms: the Browser CLI
version did not print `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, and an upgrade may
have changed it. Because the installer tracks `@latest`, the daily
`playwright-cli-banner.yml` workflow installs that same spec, launches
`show --port 0 --host 127.0.0.1` once, and feeds its stdout to this parser
(`scripts/check_playwright_cli_banner.py`); a drift fails the run with the CLI
version and every line read, and `scheduled-failure-watch.yml` files it as an
issue before users meet the fail-closed view. A present attribution path that fails names the tool, its
resolved path when applicable, and the failed control-listener check; the reason
tells the operator
to inspect permissions or the process namespace. Ownership and relay failures
otherwise describe the failed Browser-view task; PID, port, and thread details
remain in debug or warning logs. Line count, byte count, and time bound only the
proof window. A recognized report remains valid when a later limit switches the
reader to discard mode. Without a match, the limit invalidates the report. A
descriptor-backed reader duplicates the child pipe before reading; proof and
discard paths use that same owned duplicate, which the reader closes exactly
once in its `finally`. Closing or reusing the stream owner's descriptor cannot
redirect the proof source. The daemon keeps draining and discarding stdout until
EOF so a chatty long-lived child cannot fill its pipe and block. Every daemon
thread start passes one guarded helper. A failed proof
reader or post-bind relay start closes the child pipes and reaps the spawned
process; failed relay connection or pump starts close their tracked sockets.

Reuse and status enforce one final capability contract. Capable hosts re-prove
current listener ownership on every reuse. A structurally blind host may publish
only the startup result, in the same `ensure_running()` call that accepts the
exact child's private post-bind report. No publication grant is retained. Every
later status or reuse withholds the URL with
`listener ownership cannot be re-proved on this host: <tool> is absent or cannot
attribute processes`, preserves the live handle, and does not respawn per poll.
A structurally blind owner lookup publishes only at startup and never adopts a
reachable listener; an operator report that `the panel URL disappears after the
first status call on host X` identifies this rule, not a regression. Root liveness, process identity, and HTTP health prove chain of
custody and reachability but cannot prove which process currently owns the
listener when PID attribution is unavailable. The spawn proof records the root
PID, start token, and reader source. The source is `ATOMIC` for `/proc` or
libproc, `WINDOWS` for query-only process creation time, and `LSTART` for
`ps -o lstart=`. Every later root recheck uses that same source and never
compares tokens across those encodings. The blind set is empty on supported
platforms in ordinary operation: Linux uses `/proc`, Windows uses the in-process
`GetExtendedTcpTable` owner-PID table, and macOS ships `lsof`. A completed
ownership mismatch or failed health check still fails closed. An unreadable
same-source identity is inconclusive: status withholds the URL while preserving
the live handle. A dead handle is reaped once, and a fresh start must earn its
own startup publication.

The dashboard control socket cannot replace these checks with a nonce challenge
because its reveal request carries only `sessionName` and its fixed PID response
echoes no client-supplied field. The served dashboard
provides the session grid with live screencast, a session detail view with tab bar
and navigation controls, and full remote mouse and keyboard input, so a human can
take over a session directly: this is the path for a CAPTCHA or a 2FA prompt that
an agent cannot and should not complete. Escape releases input capture.

Three properties of the server must be honoured, because each failure mode
presents as a broken panel rather than as a misconfiguration:

1. **Bind `--host 127.0.0.1` explicitly.** The default listener is IPv6-only, and
   an iframe pointed at `127.0.0.1` gets a connection failure against it.
2. **Health-check for any response, not for 200.** The root path answers 302.
3. **Treat `show` as a supervised child process.** It blocks, so it needs an
   owned lifecycle rather than a fire-and-forget call. `show --kill` stops the
   daemon.

**Never pass `--host 0.0.0.0`.** The served dashboard carries full remote input on
a browser that may hold the operator's sessions, so binding it off loopback
exposes an interactive takeover surface to the network.

#### Native view focus

In the desktop app keyboard focus belongs to exactly one child view of the window, and
hiding the focused view does not move it. So when the native browser view leaves the
screen while it holds focus (an overlay, an inactive tab, a collapsed panel, close), the
manager in `website/electron/browser-view.js` hands focus back to the dashboard view
(`focusHost`), and on window focus `reclaimFocus` does the same for a hidden view that
still holds it. Without this every dashboard text input would look alive and receive no
keystrokes.

#### Address bar launcher

The Browser panel has two transports. In the desktop app a native Chromium view
owns the panel and an external site typed into the address bar lands there.
Everywhere else — a plain browser tab, including a laptop reaching a remote
gateway over an SSH tunnel — the dashboard CSP admits only loopback into the
preview iframe (`frame-src`/`connect-src` in `server.py`), so `google.com` could
neither be framed nor probed, and the panel would report a healthy public site as a
dev server that "stopped responding". The CLI's own dashboard cannot open a session for a
human (its bundle renders "No open sessions." and offers navigation only inside one
that exists), and every other `playwright-cli` invocation is an agent's shell turn.

`browser_cli/launcher.py` plus `POST /api/browser/open` (`{url, session_key}`)
is that launcher, and the panel calls it on the non-native transport when the
normalized host is not loopback. The handler ensures the `show` view is serving
(the same start path as `/api/browser/view/start`, honouring
`dashboard.browser_view_port`), then runs the CLI as a supervised child through
`install.cli_path`/`cli_command`/`cli_env`. `cli_path` accepts only the sealed
managed leaf or a fixed, non-writable system candidate; it never falls back to
PATH. `cli_command` treats that launcher as identity only and invokes a sealed or
fixed non-writable Node plus the attributed package's `playwright-cli.js`. Thus a
POSIX `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang cannot select an agent-writable
version-manager binary, and a Windows `.cmd` launcher never receives owner URL
bytes for `cmd.exe` to reparse. The same prefix starts the supervised `show`
process and performs install/version probes. If either executable in the pair is
absent or refused, no subprocess starts and the panel keeps the same plain
"playwright-cli is not installed" hint. `cli_env` still carries
`PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG`, the snapshot directory and the attach token exactly as it
does for an agent's invocation:

| Browser state (from `playwright-cli --json list`) | Command |
|---|---|
| the session is listed `open` | `playwright-cli -s=<session> goto <url>` |
| listed `closed`, or not listed | `playwright-cli -s=<session> open <url>` |
| the list cannot be read | `goto`, whose failure is reported in the CLI's own words |

`open` runs only on a positive "not open" from the CLI's structured output: a
bare `open` on a live session tears that browser down and starts another,
losing its tabs, so neither an unreadable list nor a failed `goto` may escalate
to one. The `--json` flag is part of the CLI's command surface; an error
sentence is not, which is why the decision reads the former. The answer is
`{ok, session, error, attached, view}` (the URL is the caller's own input and is not echoed); `attached`
says whether the reveal below took, so the panel names the session to pick only
when it did not; `error` is the CLI's
own text — ANSI stripped, the update banner, the 2 KB Chromium argv dump and
Node's stack preamble removed, credentials redacted, capped — so the panel
shows `No usable sandbox!` or `Chromium distribution 'chrome' is not found …`
verbatim instead of a blank frame. For the sandbox case the remedy from
[Launch config](#launch-config) is appended (the markers are Chromium's own
sandbox-failure lines, one phrasing per platform -- `No usable sandbox` on Linux,
`sandbox initialization failed` and `Failed to initialize sandbox.` on macOS,
matched case-sensitively without the errno tail -- and a miss costs only the
appended advice): the
operator names their own `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG`; the launcher never drops the
sandbox and never writes a config of its own. `view` is the post-attempt
`show` status, so the panel frames the view without a second read.

**Consent.** A human pressing Enter in an authenticated dashboard is the
approval. The route is owner-only like the view routes, is on no internal-path
list, and the handler additionally refuses a caller that authenticated with the
internal secret — an agent reaching it would bypass the shell approval ladder the
[capability model](#capability-model) routes browsing through. The URL is
re-validated server-side (`http`/`https`, a host, and no secret-bearing
component — userinfo, query, or fragment: argv is world-readable through
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for the life of the CLI process, so a `?token=` or
`#access_token=` URL would leak; this is an argv limitation, to be lifted only
if the URL can travel to the CLI outside argv) before it
becomes the ONE free element of a fixed argv, which is what keeps the spawn
benign for `test_spawn_audit`.

**One session per chat slot, named `panel-<owner6>-<slot8>`** (sha256 digests of
the owning gateway's data home and of the slot key — identifiers rather than
secrets; the owner tag is the ownership contract described under [Stranded
daemon reclamation](#stranded-daemon-reclamation)). The
name deliberately does not match the generated `kc-<8hex>` shape: the orphan
sweep reclaims a `kc-` daemon as soon as no live process carries its
`PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION`, and the only process that ever carries the panel's is
the CLI invocation that exits milliseconds later — full participation would kill
the human's browser ten minutes in. So the session is operator-class to the sweep
(structurally excluded, never signalled) and its lifetime is owned here: the
launcher records every session it opened — including an `open` that outlived
its budget, whose detached daemon may be up regardless — and `_register_browser_view_cleanup`
closes exactly those (`-s=<name> close`, never `close-all`/`kill-all`) before it
stops the view, so a gateway restart is idempotent and an operator's own browser
survives it. A gateway that dies without shutting down strands the daemon exactly
as an operator's own `open` would, and the deterministic name lets the next
gateway re-adopt it with `goto` instead of leaking a second one. `-s=` selects
the session and the child's `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` is set to the same name, so
the daemon's exec-time environ and argv agree.

**One socket root — and one daemon registry — for the gateway's own CLI
children.** The `show` child and every launcher invocation run with
`PWTEST_SOCKETS_DIR` set to `<data-home>/pw/ui/s` and `PWTEST_DAEMON_SESSION_DIR`
to `<data-home>/pw/ui/d` (`launch.ui_socket_env`; an operator-configured root is
honoured as a base and namespaced under it, one of our own arriving by
inheritance is regenerated — the doctrine of the generated sessions' roots, with
the `ui` leaf deliberately not 8-hex so nothing can read it as a session's
namespace). The registry is pinned for the same reason as the root: a gateway
started from inside an agent's shell would otherwise inherit that agent's
registry, the panel's sessions would register there, and after a crash and an
ordinary restart the sweep would list the default registry and never find the
logged-in browser; deterministic and gateway-owned, the `list` that
`reclaim_stranded` and `close_all` run reads the same registry across every
gateway life. This is the same hook the generated sessions use, gated on the same
installed-source probe, and it exists so the gateway KNOWS where its two children
meet rather than re-deriving the CLI's default path (temp directory plus a hash
of the user name). It is left unset — the children fall back to the CLI's
default and the reveal below is skipped — when the hook cannot be CONFIRMED on
the CLI that would run, when the path would overflow the AF_UNIX budget (a pod's
long home), or when the directory cannot be prepared owner-only.

**Reveal.** The `show` dashboard lists a new session in its sidebar but does not
attach its viewport to it, so after a successful launch the gateway asks it to:
one JSON line (`{"sessionName": …}`) on the dashboard app's singleton socket,
`<socket root>/dashboard/app.sock`. That layout is upstream's, so it is pinned
the way the socket-root hook is — `install.cli_dashboard_socket_support` reads
the serving `playwright-core` bundle for `makeSocketPath("dashboard", "app")`
and a rename turns the reveal into a skip reported once at WARNING in the
gateway log (not a debug line), so the loss of the auto-attach is visible. The CLI's own way to reveal,
`show -s=<name>` with no `--port`, is deliberately not used: when the singleton
socket is stale it becomes the winner and launches a Chromium app window on the
gateway host. Connecting ourselves fails closed — no listener, no reveal, nothing
else — and Windows (a named pipe) skips it.

*Attribution is not capability.* Both seam gates
(`install.cli_lifecycle_env_support`, `install.cli_dashboard_socket_support`)
answer a `SeamSupport` verdict plus a detail line, and the three values are not
degrees of the same thing. `UNSUPPORTED` means the serving bundle was READ and a
needle is gone — a real upstream capability gap, and the only verdict allowed to
describe the installed CLI. `UNVERIFIED` means no bundle was read at all: no
`@playwright/cli` package directory is attributable to the resolved launcher, no
`playwright-core` tree serves the package, or the bundle was never read — absent,
empty, past the source-size ceiling, or an I/O failure. Both still fail closed, so
an `UNVERIFIED` host keeps the CLI's own lifecycle environment untouched exactly
as before; what changes is what the log says.

Both gates anchor on the resolved launcher ALONE, through
`_cli_package_for_launcher`, and deliberately NOT on `_cli_package_dirs`. That
list falls back to the standalone install prefix, which is right for a revision
lookup — a fallback revision beats no revision — and wrong for a seam verdict,
which is a claim about the CLI that will actually run. A package belonging to a
different install answering for a launcher whose own package could not be found
is the same misreport in a narrower case. The
`UNVERIFIED` line names the launcher it could not attribute and the remedy
(`install.ATTRIBUTION_REMEDY` — install the CLI where `cli_path` resolves it),
because a capability claim there points the operator at a CLI upgrade that cannot
apply: the seams were present in every measured version, and what
varied was only whether the launcher's ancestry reached the package. `PATH` is not
a launcher source, so re-admitting a version-manager shim is deliberately NOT the
remedy. Each line is emitted once per distinct reason rather than once per session
start, keyed on the message in `launch._warned_lifecycle_losses` and
`launcher._warned_layout_losses`; a reason that CHANGED is a different host state
and speaks again, so a host moving between `UNVERIFIED` and `UNSUPPORTED` is not
held at its first reading.

*Probe note.* The reveal rests on two byte-level needles in the serving
`playwright-core` package's core bundle (the `coreBundle` file under its `lib`
directory, beside the package's `browsers.json`), measured by
`install.cli_dashboard_socket_support` before every reveal attempt:
`makeSocketPath("dashboard", "app")` (the dashboard's singleton socket) and
`process.env.PWTEST_SOCKETS_DIR ||` (the socket-root hook the launcher and the
`show` child share). The answer is cached by the bundle's path, mtime and size,
so an upstream `@playwright/cli` bump re-runs the measurement on its own; a
bundle missing either needle skips the reveal and logs the once-per-process
WARNING above. As last measured (2026-09), both needles are present in
`@playwright/cli@0.1.18` and in `playwright-core@1.63.0-alpha-2026-08-31` (the dependency
of `@playwright/cli@0.1.19`); that is the re-measure baseline.
When an upgrade turns the WARNING on, re-measure the needles against the new
bundle and either update them or cut the reveal unit (`_reveal`,
`_dashboard_socket_path`, `install.cli_dashboard_socket_support`, their tests
and this paragraph) — the page still opens and frames without it; only the
auto-attach is lost.

**Panel behaviour.** `normalizeUrl` upgrades a bare public host to `https://`
(`google.com`) and keeps `http://` for the dev-server shapes — a loopback host,
an IP literal, or any explicit port; this default is shared by both transports,
so the native view opens a bare public host on `https://` too. For a loopback
host the preview iframe path is unchanged; on the native transport an external
host still goes to the native view. While the gateway is launching, the panel
shows an opening state; on success the CLI view takes the panel, and the framed
dashboard's own URL bar, tab bar and remote input carry navigation from there —
the panel adds no second address bar beside a surface that already has one. The
view header names the session THIS CHAT LAUNCHED into, by its `panel-…` name,
and states that as a launch fact ("Opened from this chat") rather than as
ownership of what the frame is showing (#5940). The distinction is load-bearing
because the reveal above is one machine-wide switch: an agent or the CLI opening
a page for another chat's session, or a second dashboard tab, moves the single
viewport with no signal this panel can observe. A header reading "this chat's
browser" therefore described, routinely, a page the reader was not looking at.
Naming the session the frame is ACTUALLY on would need the view status to carry
it — `/api/browser/view` answers `status`, `url`, `port` and `reason`, and the
frame is cross-origin, so the panel has no other source — and that field does not
exist yet; the open half of #5940 owns it. A window event between mounted panels
is NOT a substitute: the dashboard mounts one panel per browsing context (every
`SidePanel` is passed the single active slot), so it would reach no listener, and
none of the supersedings above is a mounted panel. One sentence
under the header says how the next site is opened (the padlock above the page
unlocks the frame's own address bar; the monitor button brings the preview bar
back) and is dismissed once per browser; and when the answer says the reveal did
not attach (`attached: false`), one line names the session to pick in the frame's
sidebar — said only in that case. On
failure the panel hands back to the preview body and renders the gateway's text
through `ErrorNotice` (dismiss on the notice, one retry action). A URL with a
`?` query or `#` fragment never makes the round trip: the panel refuses the same
shape the gateway refuses (`hasQueryOrFragment`) and shows a plain hint — not an
error, nothing failed — saying where such a link goes: open the site's plain
address, then type the full link into the frame's own address bar behind its
padlock; no retry. The gateway's own `invalid_url` answer, from a caller that
skipped that check, is a rejected request and renders the same sentence through
`ErrorNotice`. Only the newest
launch on a slot may paint: every launch takes a sequence number, a slot change
bumps it, and a late answer from an older launch (a mistyped address that fails
after the corrected one succeeded, or a slot the user left) paints nothing. The
panel frames the view through the **same-origin relay** whenever the gateway
publishes one: `/api/browser/view` answers a root-relative `path`
(`/browser-view/<token>/`), the panel prefers it over the direct `url`, and the
frame is served through the dashboard's own port — so a remote or tunneled
dashboard reaches the view through the one forward it already has, with no
extra configuration. The direct loopback `url` remains as the fallback for an
old gateway whose payload carries no `path`: that URL is loopback on the
GATEWAY host, dead from a browser on another machine unless
`dashboard.browser_view_port` is pinned and that port forwarded — the panel
probes it with the same no-cors liveness check it uses for a dev server and, on
two strikes, replaces the frame with an `ErrorNotice` naming the URL and the
setting rather than showing the browser's own connection-refused page. (The
relay path never gets that probe: it is same-origin, so its health is the
dashboard's own.) The relay rewrites the view SPA's root-absolute references
and its `?ws=` socket parameter to stay under the tokened prefix; those
rewrites are pinned to the current playwright-cli bundle shape (double-quoted
`src`/`href` attributes, `url(/…)` in CSS, the `'/' + ws` socket-URL
construction), so **after a playwright-cli upgrade, open the Browser panel once
on a remote dashboard and confirm the view boots through the relay** — an
upstream bundle-shape change would silently restore the direct-URL breakage
this path exists to fix.

### Security

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Capability availability | Vetted absolute launcher identity only: `<data-home>/playwright-cli` first, then fixed system locations whose direct launcher, Node and package-entry hierarchies the gateway user cannot write. The managed prefix is on the sensitive-path floor and `_CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`, so agent file tools cannot read or replace it and every agent sandbox can execute but not modify it. Linux precreation requires the launcher leaf itself to be a real directory before and after the create race; a resolving symlink is refused because a bind mount would follow its target and leave the name replaceable. PATH, `~/.local/bin`, project and workspace candidates are ignored. On every OS gateway-owned calls use an attributed direct pair: managed `gateway-node`/`node.exe` plus contained `playwright-cli.js`, or a fixed-system Node and package entry whose complete hierarchies are non-writable. POSIX shebangs, PATH Node, and Windows batch files never receive gateway request data. See [Capability model](#capability-model) for why availability is not approval |
| Dashboard exposure | `show` is bound to `127.0.0.1`; `0.0.0.0` is never passed, because the served view carries remote input |
| Browser view relay (`/browser-view/…`) | The one token-auth bypass that proxies foreign content. Auth is a per-instance capability token in the path: minted fresh at every view-server start, disclosed only through the cookie-authed owner-gated `/api/browser/view` payload, constant-time-compared against a lock-free snapshot BEFORE the supervisor lock or its OS-level ownership probes are touched — an invalid candidate can never contend either, and the probes themselves run outside the lock on a consistent snapshot. Every unauthenticated miss answers a uniform 404; a caller already holding the current token that lands in a start window (supervisor lock held past the bounded wait) gets a retryable 503 instead — safe to distinguish precisely because only token holders can reach it. Every allow/deny is SEL-audited. Ownership is re-proved after each upstream connection is established, before any byte or frame goes downstream, closing the proof→connect race (a dead child's freed port cannot be inherited by a squatter; a restarted view's new port marks held connections stale). Every relayed non-script response is stamped with the CSP `sandbox` + `nosniff` (+ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — the token gates access, CORS only gates readability), and the panel frames it in an opaque-origin sandbox, so relayed content never runs with the dashboard origin's ambient authority |
| Address bar launcher (`POST /api/browser/open`) | Owner-only (cookie/token), on no internal-path list, and the handler refuses an internal-secret caller outright, so an agent cannot use it to skip the shell approval ladder. The URL is re-validated (`http`/`https`, host, and no secret-bearing userinfo, query, or fragment — argv is world-readable) before it is the one free argv element; the session name is derived hex; no sandbox flag is ever added and no config written — the operator's `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` is inherited as-is. Only sessions this gateway opened are closed at shutdown, never `close-all`/`kill-all`. **Accepted residual:** a token carried in the URL *path* still reaches argv for the life of the CLI process; paths stay allowed because refusing them refuses most ordinary pages. The residual closes when the CLI takes the URL outside argv — #9854 tracks that switch and its version floor |
| Native `browser` MCP tool | The tool is always advertised but re-checks the vetted CLI availability and `capabilities.browse` governance at call time. It dispatches one enum-bounded operation to the calling slot's Electron panel through internal-secret-only routes. `dashboard.use_builtin_browser=false`, an unresolved session, a missing panel, HTTP 404/503, or a transport miss returns CLI fallback guidance; governance denial never falls back. `navigate` accepts only public HTTP(S) targets as described above. Arguments are scalar or lists of scalars, result text is credential/exfiltration-URL redacted and capped, and screenshot data is not inlined into the model response. **Accepted residual:** the lenient session resolver can map a subagent process to its parent slot, so a subagent tool call may drive the parent's native panel; this stays same-user/same-machine and public-navigation-only |
| Agent reach into a `panel-` session | **Accepted residual.** A `panel-` browser can hold logins the human typed into it, and an agent drives the same CLI through its shell. What separates the populations is structural but not an enforcement boundary: an agent process runs under its own generated `PWTEST_DAEMON_SESSION_DIR`/`PWTEST_SOCKETS_DIR` namespace (see [Generated session reachability](#generated-session-reachability)), so a bare `playwright-cli -s=panel-… goto` from an agent shell resolves no session and its `list` does not show one; reaching the human's browser takes a command that also names the CLI's default registry and the gateway's socket root, both readable by a same-user process. The control on that command is the ordinary shell approval ladder, exactly as for every other `playwright-cli` invocation; the reserved prefix and the `web-browse` skill's rule are the conventions on top. An enforced isolation would be a per-population credential on the daemon socket, which the CLI does not offer |
| Reveal | One JSON line to the `show` dashboard's own singleton socket under the gateway-owned socket root both children run with, only when the installed bundle carries that layout, after a successful launch; fails closed when there is no listener. `show -s=<name>` (no port) is never run, since with a stale socket it launches a Chromium app window on the host |
| Saved state files | Owner-only permissions; they hold live session credentials |
| Launch config | Write-protected from the agent on both the file-edit and shell gates, and readable. Deliberately anchored rather than bare-token: the filename is not itself the grant, since the agent can name its own `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` — so what the entry removes is the durable form (rewriting the config the product installed), and a `cd`-relative write is the accepted residual, exactly as for `.data-home-ready` |
| Page content | Treated as untrusted input. A URL, instruction, or form target read off a page never decides the next navigation |
| Attach mode | Operates the operator's real logged-in browser, so it is the strongest form of the capability and remains behind shell approval |
| Approval | Every `playwright-cli` shell command follows the ordinary approval ladder. Presence alone never auto-approves it; only an explicit trusted pattern, session trust, or auto-approve grant can skip the prompt |

### Platform notes

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 20 or newer |
| Install | `npm install -g --prefix <data-home>/playwright-cli @playwright/cli@latest` |
| Browser binary | `install-browser <engine>`, user-local; `--with-deps` on an apt host only |
| Attach | Chromium-family only, since Playwright ships an attach extension for that family alone |

### OS dependencies

Playwright's `--with-deps` implementation is **apt-only**: on a distribution it
does not recognize it selects its nearest Ubuntu package set and runs `apt-get` as
root anyway, and because the flag and the download are one CLI invocation, a
refusal takes the download down with it. So the flag is passed only on an apt host
(`os_deps.with_deps_supported`), and a failed attempt there is retried without it,
because the download itself needs no privilege. Every other host downloads with
`install-browser <engine>` alone. Either way a missing library is reported as a
missing library, with a command the operator runs deliberately; the remedy rides
on the attempt without the flag, since that is the one a human acts on.

`browser_cli/os_deps.py` resolves the host family from `/etc/os-release`
(`ID` plus `ID_LIKE`, so derivatives resolve through their base) and composes the
remedy for the engine that failed:

| Family | `--with-deps` | Remedy appended to a failing download |
|---|---|---|
| debian / ubuntu | passed, retried without on failure | `npx playwright install-deps <engine>`, with `sudo` when the host has it |
| rpm (rhel, fedora, centos, amzn, rocky, alma, suse), Chromium | never passed | an install line for whichever supported manager the host actually has — `dnf`, else `yum`, else `microdnf`, probed not assumed — naming the rpm packages. A SUSE host gets no remedy by lineage, even if `dnf`/`yum` is installed there: `zypper`-world package names differ, so a completed line would fail on its package list |
| rpm, Firefox / WebKit | never passed | a line naming the engine and pointing at the libraries Playwright printed; no package list is offered, because the verified one covers Chromium alone |
| unrecognized Linux | never passed | none — a guessed package manager fails on its own first argument and reads as the product being broken |
| macOS / Windows | not applicable | none — the browser download alone is sufficient |

The remedy is a command for a human to run, appended to the failing step's
detail (which the settings panel renders verbatim) rather than a new UI state.
Nothing in the remedy path elevates or runs a package manager; the only elevation
is Playwright's own `--with-deps` attempt on an apt host.

**A zero exit is not a verdict.** MEASURED on Amazon Linux 2023: with libraries
missing, `install-browser` prints

```
Playwright Host validation warning:
║ Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers. ║
```

and **exits 0**, leaving the browser directories in the cache. Playwright
classifies it as a warning. Reading the exit code alone therefore reports a
browser that cannot launch as installed — the panel goes green, `browser_ok`
turns true because the build is genuinely on disk, and the real error arrives at
the user's first browse as an opaque stack trace. Every browser step is judged on
its output as well as its exit code (`os_deps.host_deps_unsatisfied`, matched
against the header and the message body so a reworded box still trips one), and a
match fails the step and carries the remedy.

`browser_ok` keeps meaning "a build is downloaded", which stays literally true on
such a host; the install error is what carries the truth that it cannot run.
Making `browser_ok` mean "and it can launch" would need a validation probe on
every settings poll.

### Standalone enterprise installer

`playwright-cli.sh` (macOS/Linux) and `playwright-cli.ps1` (Windows) install the
same `@playwright/cli` package as the install flow above, for the case that flow
cannot handle: a machine where `npm install -g` does not work. They are run by a
human at a shell, not by the gateway, and nothing in the product invokes them.

They exist because step 2 of the install flow assumes two things an enterprise
laptop often lacks — a Node toolchain of a recent enough major, and a default
registry that answers without a login. When either is missing, a bare
`npm install -g` fails with npm's own output, which does not distinguish "your
token expired" from "the registry is firewalled" from "this mirror does not carry
the package", and those three have mutually exclusive remedies. The scripts remove
both assumptions without introducing a private artifact channel: there is no Kiro
Crew-hosted Playwright build to keep in sync or to trust.

**Node is bootstrapped, not required.** A Node already on PATH is reused when its
major is at least the floor the install flow above requires, as is one recorded by
`ensure-node.sh` in `<data home>/node-bin-dir` — these installers *read* that
marker but never write it, so the sharing is one-directional: a Node they
bootstrap stays private to them, and `ensure-node.sh` still downloads its own.
That is deliberate, because `env.py` hands the marked interpreter to the gateway,
whose floor is higher again.

A reused Node is only reused if `npm` is actually beside it. On Debian and Ubuntu
`nodejs` and `npm` are separate packages, so `apt install nodejs` alone leaves a
perfectly good Node with no npm — and telling that user to install npm would hand
back the one prerequisite these installers exist to remove. Such a Node is
abandoned and a private one bootstrapped instead, because the release tarball
bundles npm. Missing npm in a tree the installer itself unpacked is a different
thing entirely — a truncated archive — and aborts rather than retrying.

Otherwise the release build for the detected platform is downloaded and its
SHA-256 checked against that release's `SHASUMS256.txt` **before it is
executed**; a mismatch, or an artifact the manifest does not list at all, aborts
the install. Selection is libc-aware because an official tarball is not portable:
musl hosts (Alpine) get the unofficial-builds variant, and so do pre-2.28-glibc
hosts (RHEL 7-era) **on x64 only**, which is the only architecture that variant
is published for. The manifest is fetched over the same channel as the artifact
and is not itself signed — identical to `ensure-node.sh`, so this is corruption
detection plus transport trust, not an independent trust root like the signed
manifest `cli.sh` verifies.

**The install is unprivileged and self-contained**, which is where it diverges
from the install flow above: `npm install --global` is run with
`npm_config_prefix` pointed at `<data home>/playwright-cli`, so nothing is written
outside the user's home and sudo is never involved. The generated entry point is a
**wrapper script, not a symlink**, written to `<prefix>/managed-bin`: npm's own shim
starts `#!/usr/bin/env node`, which would resolve against the caller's PATH. The
installer asks the verified Node process for its native `process.execPath`,
atomically copies that executable to `<prefix>/gateway-node`, and writes a wrapper
that invokes this managed copy with
`<prefix>/lib/node_modules/@playwright/cli/playwright-cli.js` directly. The
managed bin directory leads the agent subprocess PATH and remains inside the same
read-only sandbox leaf; no generated wrapper retains the source version-manager
path. Every path interpolated into it is escaped because a generated script treats
its inputs as code.

**The public registry is pinned.** An ambient `.npmrc` that redirects the default
registry at a private mirror makes a *public* package 401 the moment that mirror's
token expires. `--registry` re-points it for the opposite case (public registry
firewalled, mirror reachable), and `--isolated-npmrc` ignores the ambient config
entirely. A registry URL carrying a credential — in userinfo or in a query
parameter — is redacted everywhere the scripts print it, and the log is created
owner-only, because npm writes that URL into its own output.

**A credential may not be passed as a flag.** `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
world-readable, so `--registry https://user:token@host/` publishes the token to
every account on the machine for as long as the install runs, and leaves it in shell
history besides — neither of which redaction can reach, since redaction covers only
what the scripts print. The credential travels in the environment instead
(`KIROCREW_NPM_REGISTRY`, `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`), where `/proc/<pid>/environ` is
readable only by its owner, or through `npm login`. The refusal keys on PROVENANCE
rather than content: the resolved registry value also holds an env-supplied
credential, and refusing that would break the escape the error message recommends.

**Enterprise failures are classified, not passed through.** npm's output is kept
at `<prefix>/playwright-cli-install.log` — namespaced because a caller-supplied
prefix could otherwise make that a generic name the installer truncates — and matched against the failures a corporate network
actually produces. The browser binary is fetched during the install rather than
left to first use, for the same reason: it comes from the Playwright CDN and not
the npm registry, so a network that permits one may block the other, and doing it
here turns that into exit 16 with a mirror remedy instead of a stall inside the
user's first browse. `--with-deps` is deliberately not passed — it installs OS
packages through the system package manager, and this installer never elevates.
The full exit-code table is in `--help`; the codes that carry a diagnosis are 13
(registry rejected auth), 14 (registry unreachable), 15 (package or version
absent) and 16 (browser download blocked).
