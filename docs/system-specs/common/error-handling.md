# Error Handling

## Principles

1. Custom exceptions in `acp/transport_errors.py` (re-exported by `acp/client.py`)
   for ACP protocol/prompt errors, in `acp/session_handle.py` for runtime/transport
   errors, and in `acp/runtime.py` for runtime binding and session-start errors
2. Error strings at CLI boundaries (never expose tracebacks to users)
3. Graceful degradation — partial output returned on timeout

## Exception Hierarchy

Two independent families. `AcpError` covers protocol and prompt-level failures;
`AcpRuntimeError` covers the process and request transport underneath it.

```
AcpError (base, acp/transport_errors.py) — carries `transient`, the retry verdict
├── AcpTimeoutError        — prompt timed out, has partial_output
├── AcpPermissionNeeded    — tool approval required
├── AcpProcessDied         — kiro-cli exited unexpectedly
│   └── AcpRegistrationRateLimited — the death's stderr shows a throttled
│                            dynamic registration (HTTP 429); transient, so the
│                            retry ladders recover it instead of surfacing a
│                            terminal generic death. Classified only while the
│                            session has produced no text and run no tool, so
│                            the verdict can never license a replay that
│                            repeats side effects. An ambiguous-delivery death
│                            (a stdin stall with the child alive) is never
│                            this subclass: it stays a non-transient
│                            AcpProcessDied with ambiguous_delivery set
├── AcpAuthRequired        — kiro-cli not authenticated; non-retryable
├── AcpSandboxInitFailed   — an OS sandbox refused to initialize; non-retryable
├── AcpToolGateUnroutable  — tool calls would bypass the PreToolUse gate;
│                            non-retryable, wraps acp_tool_gate.ToolGateUnroutable
├── PiGateExtensionTampered — a shipped gate extension (Pi or DeepSeek) failed its digest check
├── AcpModelUnavailable    — requested model not entitled; non-retryable
└── AcpPromptBusy          — a prompt is already in flight on this session

AcpRuntimeError (base, acp/session_handle.py)
├── AcpRuntimeDead            — the underlying process has died
├── AcpRequestTimeout         — a request's response missed its budget
│   ├── AcpSessionStartTimeout — `session/new` timed out while a collector owns
│   │                            the possible late result (acp/runtime.py)
│   └── AcpRuntimeOverloaded  — `initialize` went unanswered while the agents
│                                slice was throttled; transient=False, because
│                                the remedy is freeing agent memory, not a retry
└── AcpWorkspaceBindingError  — descriptor-bound runtime cannot serve another cwd
    └── AcpToolSurfaceBindingError — a shared runtime cannot safely serve the
                                     requested tool surface (acp/runtime.py)
```

`AcpToolGateUnroutable` is a distinct type rather than a transport error because
the condition is a configuration fact: a respawn re-reads the same answer and
refuses again while consuming a reconnect budget meant for transport faults. The
same argument makes `AcpAuthRequired` and `AcpModelUnavailable` distinct — each
one is invalid on its own terms, so the retry ladder must be skipped rather than
walked. `AcpRequestTimeout` subclasses its base so existing
`except AcpRuntimeError` handlers keep catching it.

**A retry DROPPED after its backoff hands back everything it counted before it.**
A spent one-shot silently disarms the next real recovery; a counted attempt
shortens the next ladder and inflates its backoff seed, both for a retry that
never reached the provider. A no-requeue exit ENDS the turn, so it owes the same
per-turn budget refresh the landed and terminal arms do -- the whole ladder, not a
decrement, because an arm that already spent attempts 1..2 would otherwise stay
permanently short. The pending "retrying..." card is corrected by APPENDING a
give-up row rather than retracted, so the affordance to continue comes back
instead of the row simply disappearing.

## Boundaries

| Boundary | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| ACP → CLI | Catch `AcpError`, print user-friendly message, `sys.exit(1)` |
| JSON-RPC read | Non-JSON lines silently skipped (kiro-cli debug output) |
| Config load | Invalid JSON → log warning, return defaults |
| Skill index (`list_skills`) | One global SKILL.md that is not UTF-8 or cannot be opened → one warning naming the file, that row dropped, every other row listed. Never a failed listing: the index feeds every chat turn and `GET /api/skills`. Rationale: [memory-skills-hooks](../modules/memory-skills-hooks.md) |
| Process spawn | Backend-specific executable resolver, including trusted-path checks where required; clear error if missing |
| Notes git subprocess (`md_notebook/git_ops.py`) | A non-zero exit reports git's last 3 stderr lines PLUS the first transport-caused line when one sits outside that tail. git ends every fetch/push failure with the same access-rights boilerplate and prints an SSH diagnosis first, so a tail alone reports a permission problem the operator does not have (a host reachable only via `~/.ssh/config` never resolved at all). The extra line widens what the message reports; it does not decide whether the command failed. |
| asyncio loop callback | A Windows Proactor reset repeated by its `connection_lost` close callback is warning-only; task-level connection resets and other exceptions remain ERRORs with crash breadcrumbs |

## Dashboard Error Codes

Dashboard JSON errors include a stable lower-snake `code` alongside advisory
`error` text, preserving the route's HTTP status. Redact untrusted text fields
before putting them in a transparent response dictionary. A computed status is
compliant when that dictionary carries an explicit code; an uncoded or opaque
body remains debt in `test/test_error_code_contract.py`. That guard also checks
literal code values on computed-status responses and refuses dictionary spreads
that could replace the code.

## Dashboard Error Hand-off

`ErrorNotice`'s optional **Ask the agent** action resolves the structured report,
stages its prompt in the error hand-off FIFO, then navigates to `/chat` through
the imperative navigator installed by `App`. The installed navigator carries the
same `useMayLeaveForNavigation` answer used by shell links. `sendErrorToChat`
asks that answer before it writes the FIFO or notifies a mounted chat subscriber;
a veto therefore leaves the current page, its draft, and the hand-off queue
unchanged. With no registered page guard the answer remains `true`, preserving
the existing hand-off. The root error boundary's explicit hard-navigation mode
continues to bypass the live React tree and stages before reloading.

The ask happens exactly once per click. A surface that already has a leave gate
in scope (the notification sheet's crash fallback, through `AskAgentButton`'s
`gate` built on `useGuardedLeave`) asks the page through that gate; the hand-off
it then runs passes `leaveGranted` to `sendErrorToChat`, which skips the
installed navigator's own ask. Both reads are the same
`useMayLeaveForNavigation` channel, and a page guard that confirms a draft away
keeps the draft dirty until the page unmounts, so a second ask was a second live
confirm — one whose "keep my draft" cancelled a hand-off the first ask had
already accepted. An ungated caller still asks through the navigator.

A failed run is a hand-off source too, not only a failed request (#7403). An
expanded `failure` or `timeout` row in a scheduled job's history (`LogEntry`)
renders `AskAgentButton` with a report built by `utils/cronRunReport.prompt.ts`:
job name and id, run id, trigger, start time, the row's summary, and the TAIL of
the run's trace (scrubbed by `redactSecrets` before the cut, capped at
`MAX_TRACE_TAIL`), so the agent receives the reason a run failed, which a run
reports at the end. The job and run ids let the agent read more history itself.
`cancelled` and `success` rows offer nothing. The hand-off goes to the ordinary
chat with no per-job "debug agent" setting: the agent that opens is the one the
user would otherwise paste the log into, and a history row holds no draft.

## Backend Error Classification

`acp/transport_errors.py` (re-exported by `acp/client.py`) rewrites raw JSON-RPC
backend errors into actionable user text (`_format_acp_error`) and decides
retry-eligibility (`_is_transient_raw_error`).
Both key off the SAME module-level `_RE_*` patterns so wording and retry verdict
never drift. Notable terminal (non-retryable) classes:

- **Context window overflow**: the provider's exact "The context window
  overflowed" rejection becomes an ordinary `AcpError` with `transient=False`,
  `structural_terminal=True`, and `context_overflow=True`. `_raise_acp_error`
  constructs it through the common `AcpError` path and applies all three facts
  in the existing data-field-only structural tag block; an echo in the JSON-RPC
  `message` cannot classify an unrelated failure. It is terminal on the same
  native session: replaying the same startup envelope cannot make it smaller. A
  surface may replace the session or runtime only when no model text or tool side
  effect was observed; subagents use one shared-to-dedicated retry.
- **Malformed request**: a structural rejection (backend "Improperly formed
  request"). Classified TERMINAL: the identical payload cannot succeed on
  retry, so the message states the request was malformed and points at a repair
  affordance (`/compact` to shrink and repair the conversation, or starting a new
  conversation) rather than suggesting a retry. The reset affordance is PROSE,
  not a command: this formatter does not know which surface renders the string,
  and the reset command differs per surface (`/new` on Telegram and Discord, a
  new tab on the dashboard), so naming one spelling hands every other surface's
  user a command that does nothing. A command may be named here only if
  every surface UNDERSTANDS it: `/compact` qualifies because it reaches the
  backend through the prompt transport everywhere, even on Slack, which also
  offers `!compact` as its own alias. The same rule governs the sibling
  prompt-busy branch, which for the same reason now names no command at all.
- **Lost backend session**: when `acp_error_is_session_not_found` matches, the
  turn resets the session binding and queues ONE `SYNTHETIC_RECOVERY_KIND` retry
  with a reconnect notice, armed as `ReplayFamily.SESSION_NOT_FOUND`. A Stop that
  already resolved suppresses it; the drain and consume seams veto it on a later
  Stop, a queued follow-up or steer, or a rebind (with a cancel notice), refunding
  the one-shot. A second loss on the same turn ends with the give-up text.
- **Unsupported image history**: Kiro's `IMAGE_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED` /
  `ImageValidationError` is terminal and structural. The exception also carries
  the narrower `image_format_unsupported` tag. A current attachment is left in
  place with remove-or-re-encode guidance; a dashboard turn with no new
  attachments may discard the native resume SID once and retry from Kiro Crew's
  bounded text transcript, which excludes native binary image blocks.
  "No new image" is the prompt builder's own answer: a picture counts only
  when the send's image list would inline a block, judged by the same
  predicate `build_prompt_blocks` uses (`inline_image_payload`), because the
  builder never scans the message text for a path — a typed or appended path,
  a file or folder attachment, or a listed file that inlines nothing (an SVG,
  an unreadable path) ships no picture. So a turn that inlined no image can
  only have been rejected for an image retained in native history; a turn WITH
  a new image falls through to
  the terminal guidance rather than clearing a healthy conversation and
  re-inlining the same bytes.
  The queued recovery turn is gated at DISPATCH, not only at enqueue: the
  conversation discard and the pending-reset consume are awaited between the two,
  and a soft Stop in that window preserves the queue while `_stopping` snaps back
  to idle. The slot therefore records the recovery's queue id plus the slot- and
  session-scoped stop generations at enqueue, and the queue drain drops the entry
  (refunding the shared one-shot) when either counter moved, when user input
  queued behind it, or when the slot was rebound to another session — the same
  rule (`RecoveryReplays.revalidate`, `dashboard/recovery_replays.py`) the
  model-access and refusal replays
  carry, re-checked at the turn's consume seam. One requeue is exempt, decided
  at the requeue: a verbatim requeue of a sub-agent completion the model never
  consumed is a result the parent is still owed, so it is queued again as the
  completion it is (`SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_KIND`), with no recovery record, and
  runs ahead of a newer user message instead of being suppressed or cancelled
  by a soft Stop. A hard kill discards it, and runner-written text queued for
  the completion (a continuation, a retry prompt) is never exempt.
- **Oversized request**: kiro-cli's own refusal, `This message is too large to
  send, and it contains no text that can be shortened. Remove or reduce the
  attached content and try again.` It is emitted when the context overflowed
  and the pending message is irreducible (image blocks have no truncated form),
  and kiro-cli neither compacts on the way to saying so nor appends the failed
  message to the native history, so the conversation is byte-identical before
  and after the failure and the identical payload is refused identically on
  every retry. Classified TERMINAL and tagged `structural_terminal` like the
  two rejections above — a size verdict rather than a shape verdict, but
  equally deterministic, and the tag is what stops a self-prompting loop from
  re-sending the same attachment every cycle. Matched against the provider
  `data` field only, where kiro-cli's ACP server places an agent-loop error
  (`message` is the `-32603` boilerplate). The terminal verdict is stated
  explicitly in the classifier because the sentence ends in "try again", which
  a retry-hint pattern must not read as a momentary blip. No curated copy: the
  provider's sentence already names the remedy, so the unknown-shape path shows
  it verbatim, and it does not carry `image_format_unsupported` — the
  conversation-discard recovery above is for a rejected image, not for a
  request that is merely too big.
- **Usage limit** and **model not entitled**: allowance spent, or the plan lacks
  the model; also terminal, with guidance to switch model or tier.

The auth family has exactly ONE transient member, **credential propagation**.
Bedrock refuses a freshly minted credential with "The security token included in
the request is invalid" — usually wrapped in `UnrecognizedClientException` and
carrying a 403 — until IAM has propagated it, and the identical credential is
accepted seconds later, so the existing backoff ladder absorbs it.
`is_credential_propagation_delay` is the single predicate, read ahead of
`_RE_AUTH` and the session-expiry branch in BOTH the classifier and the
formatter, ahead of `llm_helpers._is_transient_acp_error`'s
`accessdenied`/`unrecognizedclient` exclusion short-circuit (a
`_TRANSIENT_MARKERS` entry alone is unreachable, because the exclusion sits
above the markers), and inside `is_auth_failure_output` so `acp/runtime.py`'s
stderr latch does not convert it to the explicitly non-retryable
`AcpAuthRequired` and skip the ladder entirely. It is scoped to the "is invalid"
WORDING, never to the status: a bare 401/403, an `... is expired` token, a
combined "invalid or expired", and an invalid *bearer* token all stay terminal.
The predicate lives in `credential_errors.py`, not `acp/client.py`, so consumers
on the application side of the agent-SDK boundary share one verdict without a
fresh ACP-layer import edge.

That wording is shared with a permanently invalid access key
(`UnrecognizedClientException` or `InvalidClientTokenId` for a key that was
deleted, rotated, or mistyped), so a never-valid credential is also classified
transient. The retry budget bounds that misclassification — three retries, ~15 s
— and the formatted message closes with the terminal "refresh your AWS
credentials" guidance rather than asserting the propagation diagnosis as fact.

Retry hints are the other wording-only signal, and they are **provider-scoped**:
`_RE_5XX_HINT` carries one alternative per backend spelling ("please try again"
for Kiro/Bedrock, "try your request again" for the claude-agent-acp seam's
generic upstream 500, whose frame has no named exception and no HTTP status, so
the hint is its only transient marker). Onboarding a backend means auditing that
alternation. The kiro-cli mid-stream envelope ("Encountered an error in the
response stream: …") is deliberately NOT a hint — matching it would make the
branch a catch-all that discards the real cause.

## Model-Side Refusals

A refusal is a turn the model DECLINED, not a turn that failed: the request
reached the model and the answer is "no". It is deterministic — the same prompt
hits the same filter — so it is never retried, and the useful thing to show is
the reason. Harnesses report that reason unevenly, so `acp/types.RefusalInfo`
is the one shape every harness is folded onto (`category`,
`explanation`, `recommended_model`), each field left EMPTY when the provider
did not say — never guessed.

- **Kiro (kiro-cli, KAS)** — the service's content filter emits a
  `_kiro.dev/metadata` frame with `stopReason: CONTENT_FILTERED` and a `refusal`
  object, streams the canned explanation ("The selected model cannot continue
  this conversation…") as ordinary assistant text, then ends the turn with a
  plain `end_turn` (or a bare `-32603`). `acp/_dispatch.parse_refusal` reads the
  frame (members of `ACP_BACKENDS_STRUCTURED_REFUSAL` only) onto
  `AcpPromptStats.refusal`; `AcpPromptStats.terminal_refusal` rewrites the
  terminal's stop reason to `STOP_REASON_REFUSAL` and attaches the payload as
  `AcpEvent.refusal`. The explanation is redacted at the parser.
- **claude-agent-acp, codex-acp** — only Anthropic's bare `stopReason: "refusal"`
  reaches the client; `terminal_refusal` passes it through with no payload, and
  the dashboard's refusal branch (keyed on the stop reason) renders the bare card.
- **Dashboard** — `chat_runner.refusal_card_text` renders one card from
  `RefusalInfo`: the lead line, then one line per non-empty field. Because the
  Kiro explanation streams as text, the card is emitted from BOTH the answered
  and the text-less branch of the turn epilogue.
